{"Category:Baked goods": {"body": "", "pages": ["Baking", "Help:Categories", "Category:Baked goods"]}, "Portal:Italy": {"body": "Biscotti (, Italian: [bi\u02c8sk\u0254tti]; lit.\u2009'biscuits'), known also as cantucci (Italian: [kan\u02c8tutt\u0283i]), are Italian almond biscuits that originated in the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo.\n\nName\nCantuccio is an old Italian word that literally means 'little place', 'nook', or 'corner' but that, in the past, was also used to indicate a little piece of bread with a lot of crust (usually the first and last slices of the loaf, the \"corners\").\nThe word biscotto, used in modern Italian to refer to a biscuit (or cookie) of any kind, originates from the medieval Latin word biscoctus, meaning 'twice-cooked'. It characterised oven-baked goods that were baked twice, so they became very dry and could be stored for long periods of time. Such non-perishable food was particularly useful during journeys and wars, and twice-baked breads were a staple food of the Roman legions.The word biscotto, in this sense, shares its origin with the British English (via Old French) word biscuit, which refers to what American English speakers call a \"cookie\". In modern Italian, the word biscotto refers to any cookie or cracker, just as does the British use of the word biscuit (the number of bakings and the degree of hardness are not relevant to the term). In other countries, the term biscotti, used as a singular, refers only to the specific Italian biscuit known in Italy as cantuccio.\n\nHistory\nItaly\nAlthough commonly used to indicate the biscuits of Prato, biscotti di Prato, in modern Italy they are also known widely by the name \"cantuccini\". These names actually suggest other similar regional products of Italy. The term cantuccini is most commonly used today in Tuscany, but originally refers to variations or imitations which deviate from the traditional recipe in a few key points such as the use of yeasts, acids (to make them less dry) and flavourings. Rusks are larger, longer biscuits, rustic bread dough enriched with olive oil and anise seeds.\nThe confusion on the name may have been born from the fact that on the old sign (still present) of \"Biscottificio Antonio Mattei\", the leading manufacturer of biscuits of Prato, is written just below the name of the shop \"Manufacturers of cantuccini\", which at the time were one of the major products of the biscuits. The sign has remained unchanged, and after such a long time people are accustomed to associate the name cantuccini with the biscuits typical of Sardinia and Sicily.\n\nThe rest of Europe\nThe Old French word bescoit passed into the English language as \"biscuit\", although in English as in Italian \"biscuit\" does not refer specifically to a twice-baked biscuit.\nIn France, a similar biscuit is known as croquant.In Spain and France, the Catalan carquinyoli (Catalan: [k\u0259\u027eki\u02c8\u0272\u0254li]; pl.: carquinyolis) is made with whole or sliced almonds and is also associated with several Catalan-speaking territories. In Batea, La Fatarella, and Prat de Comte, all inland municipalities of Catalonia, and in the Terra Alta, they are also called carquinyols.Biscotti are traditional also in some inland towns in Valencia, where they are called rosegons or roseg\u00f3s. In Menorca, carquinyols are square shaped and do not include whole almonds. One Catalan food writer states that carquinyoli is derived from the French croquignole. Croquignole, another name for these biscotti, is a French word of Germanic origin.\n\nNorth America\nIn North America, where \"biscuit\" has taken on other meanings, any twice-baked biscuits are likely to be known as biscotti.\n\nRecipe\nFollowing rediscovery of the original recipe by Prato pastry chef Antonio Mattei in the nineteenth century, his variation is what is now accepted as the traditional recipe for biscotti. Mattei brought his cakes to the Exposition Universelle of Paris of 1867, winning a special mention.\nThe mixture is composed exclusively of flour, sugar, eggs, pine nuts, and almonds that are not roasted or skinned. The traditional recipe uses no form of yeast or fat (butter, oil, milk). The barely wet dough is then cooked twice: once in slab form, and again after cutting in sliced form, with the second baking defining how hard the biscotti are.\nTraditionally in Italy, biscotti di Prato are sold together with another sweet speciality of Prato, the bruttiboni. Served after dessert, they are usually combined with orange juice.\n\nModern variations\nToday the regional variations of the original are still adhered to, but the modern mass-manufactured biscotti are in fact closer to cantuccini, variations of biscotti.\nModern biscotti recipes often contain nuts (traditional almonds, pine nuts, pistachios, and hazelnuts are popular choices) or spices such as anise or cinnamon.\nModern recipes include adding baking powder and spices to the flour. The nuts are then added to allow them to be coated, with the skins being left particularly when using almonds and hazelnuts. Separately, eggs are beaten together, and then any wet flavouring (e.g., almond extract or liquor), before being added to the dry ingredients. Following twice baking (once in long slab form, secondly in cut sliced form), the biscotti may be dipped in a glaze, such as chocolate.\n\nUse\nSince they are very dry, biscotti traditionally are served with a drink, into which they may be dunked. In Italy they are typically served as an after-dinner dessert with a Tuscan fortified wine called Vin Santo.\nOutside of Italy, they more frequently accompany coffee, including cappuccinos and lattes, or black tea.\nIn Catalonia, carquinyolis are usually served with a small glass of a sweet dessert wine, such as muscat or moscatell.\n\nCulture\nIn the Catalan city Vic, \"Carquinyoli\" is also the name of a ceremonial figure who orchestrates an annual summer festival in honor of the patron saint Albert of Sicily. In Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, biscotti with almonds are called currutacos and are most typically associated with Palm Sunday, when they are used to ornament the palm leaves that are distributed to worshipers.Biscotti are much used as an ingredient in a variety of traditional dishes. In Catalonia, such dishes include rice with sardines and rabbit with snails. They are also used in sauces with onions (specifically cal\u00e7ots). In coastal Baix Llobregat, biscotti are used in the sauce for a dish of duck stuffed with turnips.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nUmberto Mannucci, Bisenzio tradizioni e cucina, Libreria del Palazzo, Prato, 1973.\n\nExternal links\n\nRecipes\nCooking For Engineers: biscotti recipe\nTwice-Cooked Delights.

The Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Scandinavia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey. It is a type of crisp, sweetened bread, made with eggs and baked twice. It originated in East Prussia. According to Fabian Scheidler, Albrecht von Wallenstein invented zwieback to feed his mercenary army during the Thirty Years' War. The Mennonites brought Zwieback to the Russian Empire; before the Russian Revolution, when many emigrated to the west,  they brought Zwieback to Canada, the United States and other parts of the world.\nThere are two types of zwieback. One type is made by pinching round pieces of dough, placing one piece on top of another, pressing them together by pushing a finger down through both pieces.  It is then baked and served as warm soft rolls.  This type is identified with Mennonites.\nThe other type is a bread sliced before it is baked a second time, which produces crisp, brittle slices that closely resemble melba toast. Zwieback is commonly used to feed teething babies  and as the first solid food for patients with an upset stomach.\nThe name comes from German zwei (\"two\") or zwie (\"twi-\"), and backen, meaning \"to bake\". Zwieback hence literally translates to \"twice-baked\". The French and Italian names, respectively, biscotte and fette biscottate have the same origin, biscotto (biscuit), which also means twice (\"bis-\") baked (-\"cotto\"). The Slovene name is prepe\u010denec which would imply baked over ordinary or overbaked. The Serbo-Croatian name is dvopek which, again, is literally twice (dvo) baked (pek).\n\nRussian Mennonite Zwieback\nRussian Mennonite zwieback, called Tweebak in Plautdietsch, is a yeast bread roll formed from two pieces of dough that are pulled apart when eaten. Placing the two balls of dough one on top of the other so that the top one does not fall off during the baking process is part of the art and challenge that must be mastered by the baker. Traditionally, this type of zwieback is baked Saturday and eaten Sunday morning and for afternoon Faspa (Standard German: \"Vesper\"), a light meal.This zwieback originated in the port cities of the Netherlands or Danzig, where toasted, dried buns were used to provision ships. Mennonite immigrants from the Netherlands, who settled in around Danzig in West Prussia continued this practice and brought it to Russia, when they migrated to new colonies in what is today Ukraine.Traditionally, zwieback are made using lard instead of butter or a mixture of the two. As such, zwieback is very rich and does not need butter when being eaten, although jelly or jam both go quite well. Many zwieback recipes do not use modern units of measurement, instead relying on anecdotal measurements handed down through the generations.\n\nSee also\nBiscotti\nBrandt (company)\nRussian Mennonite zwieback (Tweebak)\nToast\nRussian Mennonite\nRusk\nMennonite cuisine\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Albrecht von Wallenstein", "Baked", "Biscotti", "Brandt (company)", "Bread", "Bread roll", "Brittle", "Butter", "Canada", "Danzig", "East Prussia", "Egg (food)", "Flour", "German cuisine", "German language", "Germany", "ISBN (identifier)", "Lard", "Melba toast", "Mennonite", "Mennonite cuisine", "Plautdietsch", "Rusk", "Russian Empire", "Russian Mennonite", "Russian Mennonite zwieback", "Russian Revolution", "Serbo-Croatian language", "Slovenian language", "Sugar", "Teething", "Thirty Years' War", "Toast (food)", "United States", "West Prussia", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Template:Germany-cuisine-stub", "Template talk:Germany-cuisine-stub", "Help:Authority control", "Help:IPA/Standard German", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from September 2019", "Category:Articles with GND identifiers", "Portal:Food"]}, "Category:Cheese dishes": {"body": "Sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr (Czech pronunciation: [\u02c8sma\u0292\u025bni\u02d0 \u02c8si\u02d0r]) or vypr\u00e1\u017ean\u00fd syr (Slovak pronunciation: [\u02c8\u028bipra\u02d0\u0290ani\u02d0 \u02c8sir]) \u2013 both meaning \"fried cheese\" \u2013 is a Czech and Slovak cheese-based dish that is widely consumed in both countries of the former state of Czechoslovakia.

Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a cr\u00eape or dry-cured ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.\nA whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions before wrapping and baking.\n\nNaming\nWhile historians generally believe that the dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the precise origin of the name is unclear and no definite connection between the dish and the duke has been found.Leah Hyslop, writing in The Daily Telegraph, observed that by the time Wellington became famous, meat baked in pastry was a well-established part of English cuisine, and that the dish's similarity to the French filet de b\u0153uf en cro\u00fbte (fillet of beef in pastry) might imply that \"beef Wellington\" was a \"timely patriotic rebranding of a trendy continental dish\". However, she cautioned, there are no 19th-century recipes for the dish. There is a mention of \"fillet of beef, \u00e0 la Wellington\" in the Los Angeles Times of 1903, and an 1899 reference in a menu from the Hamburg-America line.In the Polish classic cookbook, finished in 1909 and published for the first time in 1910, by Maria Ochorowicz-Monatowa (1866-1925), Uniwersalna ksi\u0105\u017cka kucharska (\"The Universal Cooking Book\"), there is a recipe for \"Pol\u0119dwica wo\u0142owa \u00e0 la Wellington\" (beef fillet \u00e0 la Wellington). The recipe does not differ from the dish later known under this name. It is a beef filet enveloped together with duxelles in puff pastry, baked, and served with a truffle or Madeira sauce. The author, who mastered her cooking skills both in Paris and Vienna at the end of the 19th century, claimed that she had received this recipe from the cook of the imperial court in Vienna. She also included \"filet \u00e0 la Wellington\" in the menus proposed for the \"exquisite dinners\".In Le R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine a professional reference cookbook published by Th\u00e9odore Gringoire and Louis Saulnier in 1914, there is mentioned a garnish \"Wellington\" to beef, described as: \"Fillet browned in butter and in the oven, coated in poultry stuffing with dry duxelles added, placed in rolled-out puff pastry. Cooked in the oven. Garnished with peeled tomatoes,lettuce, Pommes ch\u00e2teau\".\nAn installment of a serialized story entitled \"Custom Built\" by Sidney Herschel Small in 1930 had two of its characters in a restaurant in Los Angeles that had \"beef Wellington\" on its menu. The first occurrence of the dish recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary is a quotation from a 1939 New York food guide with \"Tenderloin of Beef Wellington\" which is cooked, left to cool, and rolled in a pie crust.\n\nVariations\nIn the Food Network show Good Eats, Alton Brown discusses a variant using the cheaper pork tenderloin instead of beef.\n\nSee also\nShooter's sandwich\nList of

Variations include the mushroom and shrimp sauce timballo Alberoni, named after Giulio Alberoni, and the veal and tomato sauce timballo pattadese.\n\nEtymology\nThe name comes from the French word for 'kettledrum' (timbale). Varieties of timballo differ from region to region, and it is sometimes known as a bomba, tortino, sart\u00f9 (a type of Neapolitan timballo with rice and tomato sauce) or pasticcio (which is used more commonly to refer to a similar dish baked in a pastry crust). It is also known as timpano and timbale. It is similar to a casserole and is sometimes referred to in English as a pie or savory cake.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish is prepared in a dome or springform pan and eggs or cheese are used as a binder.  Rice is commonly used as an ingredient in Emilia-Romagna, where the dish is referred to as a bomba and baked with a filling of pigeon or other game bird, peas, local cheese and a base of dried pasta. Cr\u00eapes are used as a base in Abruzzo, and other regions use ravioli or gnocchi. In Sicily, it is typically made with pasta and eggplant.Mushroom sauce or fonduta, a rich Piedmontese cheese soup and sauce, are sometimes used, and Anna Del Conte wrote that b\u00e9chamel is the most consistently used ingredient in timballo.\n\nIn popular culture\nTimballo featured prominently in the 1996 film Big Night, although the dish there is referred to as timpano (a regional or family term).In December 2020, The Washington Post reported that making timpano is a Christmas tradition in Anthony Fauci's household.\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\nList of pasta\nList of pasta dishes\nLasagna\nPastitsio\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTimballo Siciliano recipe\nRayner, Jay (17 October 2021). \"The day I cooked timpano with Stanley Tucci\".

Since fillets are often referred to as supr\u00eames in professional cookery, the dish is also called \"supr\u00eame de volaille \u00e0 la Kiev\". Stuffed chicken breast is generally known in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines as c\u00f4telette de volaille. Though it has disputed origins, the dish is particularly popular in the post-Soviet states, as well as in several other countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and in the English-speaking world.\n\nHistory\nThe history of this dish is not well documented, and various sources make claims about its origin. Since the 18th century, Russian chefs have adopted many techniques of French haute cuisine and combined them with the local culinary tradition. The adoption was furthered by the French chefs, such as Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame and Urbain Dubois, who were hired by Russian gentry. In particular, the use of high quality meat cuts, such as various cutlets, steaks, escalopes and supr\u00eames became widespread in the 19th century, and a number of original dishes involving such components were developed in Russia at that time.\n\nC\u00f4telette de volaille\nThe French term de volaille means \"of poultry\" and denotes almost exclusively chicken dishes in French cookbooks. The name c\u00f4telette de volaille means thus simply \"chicken cutlet\". Despite the original French name, the Russian recipe is unknown in French cuisine, where the term c\u00f4telette de volaille refers to chicken breasts in general and is used nearly synonymously with chicken filet or supr\u00eame. The French term also denotes a minced chicken cutlet-shaped patty. The general Russian term for chicken cutlets, kurinaya kotleta (\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430), refers predominantly to such minced cutlets, whereas kotleta de-voliay (\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0439) is applied exclusively to the stuffed chicken breast dish. The latter name appears in the pre- and post-revolutionary Russian literature (in cookbooks as well as in fiction) since the beginning of the 20th century and is usually mentioned as a common restaurant dish.The recipe in the classical Russian cookery textbook The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva (which had eleven editions between 1899 and 1916) includes a complex stuffing similar to quenelle (a mixture of minced meat, in this case the rest of the meat of the chicken, and cream) but with butter added. It also points out that \"the cutlets de volaille are made from whole chicken fillets, like the game cutlets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\". The recipe is preceded by a similar one for \"hazel grouse cutlets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" with a quenelle and truffle stuffing. Another Russian cookbook published at the same time gives basically identical recipes for c\u00f4telette de volaille and c\u00f4telette \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale and notes that the only difference between them is that the former are made of chicken while the latter are made of game, such as hazel grouse, blackcock, etc.The term \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale (\"marshal-style\") denotes in French cookery tender pieces of meat, such as cutlets, escalopes, sweetbreads, or chicken breasts, which are treated \u00e0 l'anglaise (\"English-style\"), i.e. coated with egg and breadcrumbs, and saut\u00e9ed. Numerous recipes of such dishes, some of them with stuffings, are described in both Western and Russian cookbooks of the 19th century. Among the stuffed versions, one finds a recipe for a \"fowl fillet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" stuffed with truffles and herbs in The Art of French Cuisine of the 19th Century (1847) by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, and a similar filet de poulets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale with herbs and forcemeat in La cuisine classique (1868) by Urbain Dubois. Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, the most successful Russian cookbook of the 19th century, has included since its first edition in 1861 an elaborate recipe for \"hazel grouse \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" stuffed with Madeira sauce, portobello mushrooms and truffles.\n\nPozharsky cutlet\nThe main difference between the old time c\u00f4telette de volaille and the modern chicken Kiev is that the elaborate stuffings of the former are replaced by butter. The use of butter for chicken cutlets has been known in Russian cuisine at least since the invention of the Pozharsky cutlet in the first half of the 19th century. The Pozharsky cutlets are breaded ground chicken patties for which butter is added to minced meat. This results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. The dish was a widely appraised invention of 19th-century Russian cuisine, which was also adopted by French haute cuisine and subsequently by the international cuisine.While the roots of chicken Kiev can thus be traced back to French haute cuisine and Russian cookery of the 19th century, the origin of the particular recipe known today as chicken Kiev remains disputed.\n\nIndividual attributions\nThe Russian Tea Room Cookbook notes that chicken Kiev was \"most likely ... a creation of the great French chef Car\u00eame at the Court of Alexander I.\" Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame spent just several months of the year 1818 in St. Petersburg, but made a profound impact on Russian cuisine in this short time. The reforms carried out by his followers introduced in particular various meat cuts into Russian cookery. The recipe of the Russian c\u00f4telette de volaille is not present in Car\u00eame's major work mentioned above, but his \"fowl fillet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" could have served as the starting point for the further development of such dishes.\nSome Russian sources attribute the creation of this dish (or of its precursor) to Nicolas Appert, French confectioner and chef, best known as the inventor of airtight food preservation. In contrast, common biographic sources for Appert do not mention this dish, and the origin of these claims is unclear.\n\nNovo-Mikhailovsky cutlet\nRussian food historian William Pokhlyobkin claimed that chicken Kiev was invented in 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in \u0430 St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlets and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these cutlets are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky cutlet, with the only difference being the meat pounded by a tenderizer until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after the use of a grinder. The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.The second claim of Pokhlyobkin's version is invalidated, as the references of chicken Kiev appeared in published sources much earlier, since the 1910s.\n\nModern chicken Kiev\nOral tradition in Kyiv attributes the invention of the \"cutlet de volaille Kiev-style\" (kot\u0142eta de-voljaj po-kyjiv\u015bky) to the restaurant of the Continental hotel in Kyiv in the beginning of the 20th century. A luxury hotel built in 1897 in the center of Kyiv, it was run until the Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The building was then mined by the retreating Red Army and exploded when the German Army occupied Kyiv in September 1941. After the war, the building was rebuilt and has since then been used by the Kyiv Conservatory. According to the memoirs of contemporaries, Chicken Kiev was the signature dish of the hotel's restaurant.\nAn early reference of \"Kiev cutlets from chicken or veal\" is found in the Cookery Digest (1915), a collection of recipes which were published in the Moscow Journal for Housewives in 1913\u20131914. These were minced meat cutlets similar to the Pozharsky cutlets, but shaped like a croquette with a bar of cold butter placed in the middle. Like modern chicken Kiev, the croquettes were covered with egg and breadcrumbs and fried.Later, \"chicken cutlets Kiev-style\" were listed in Apportionments for dinners, separate dishes and other products of public catering (1928) which served as a standard reference for Soviet catering establishments. The book also included other items for chicken cutlets, such as \"cutlet de volaille\" and \"cutlet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\". The book demanded renaming of many traditional restaurant dishes to replace the (mostly French-style) \"bourgeois\" names with simple \"proletarian\" forms. In particular, the \"cutlet Kiev-style\" had to be renamed into \"chicken cutlet stuffed with butter\". This program was not realised immediately (at least not completely), and its successor, The Directory of Apportionments for Catering (1940), published by the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry, still included the traditional names. In post-World War II publications of this directory and in other Soviet cookery books, such as Cookery (1955), the \"Kiev-style\" name was retained, but the terms de volaille and \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale were indeed dropped in favour of simple names such as \"chicken cutlet stuffed with milk sauce\", \"chicken cutlet stuffed with liver\" and \"chicken cutlet stuffed with chicken quenelle and mushrooms\". As a result of this policy, the names de volaille and \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale disappeared from menus of Soviet restaurants.\nThe \"old-style\" name \"cutlet de volaille Kiev-style\" was occasionally mentioned in some post-World War II Soviet fiction books. In particular, in a short story This Is Not Written In A Cookbook (1947) by Yevgeny Vorobyov, a Soviet soldier and a former chef in a Moscow noble hotel explains to his comrade in arms, that \"cutlets de volaille are made for two tastes. There are cutlets de volaille Kiev-style and cutlets de volaille jardiniere.\"The name kotlet de volaille is used to this day for chicken Kiev in Poland. The name is oftentimes polonised as dewolaj (dewolaje for plural).Mentions of chicken Kiev are also found in US newspapers starting from 1937. The reports describe the Russian-style restaurant Yar in Chicago serving this dish. The restaurant existed until 1951 and was run by Vladimir Yaschenko, a former colonel of the imperial Russian army. It was styled after the famous eponymous Moscow restaurant and was frequented by celebrities of that time. After World War II, US newspapers mentioned chicken Kiev served in New York restaurants. Recipes for a \"chicken cutlet \u00e0 la Kiev\" were published in The New York Times in 1946 and in Gourmet magazine in 1948.Since the end of the 1940s or beginning of the 1950s, chicken Kiev became a standard fare in Soviet high class restaurants, in particular in the Intourist hotel chain serving foreign tourists. Tourist booklets warned the diners of the danger it presented to their clothing. At the same time the popularity of this dish grew in the US. According to Darra Goldstein chicken Kiev became \"a symbol of Russian haute cuisine\".In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada rebranded their versions of the dish to \"chicken Kyiv\" (in line with the general media shift from the Russian-derived name \"Kiev\" to \"Kyiv\") to show respect and support for Ukraine and Ukrainians.\n\nVariants\nChicken Kiev is made from a boned and skinned breast which is cut lengthwise, pounded and stuffed with butter. Western recipes usually call for garlic butter, while in Russian ones regular butter is used. Herbs (parsley and dill) can be added to the butter. In some American recipes butter is replaced by blue cheese.In the classical preparation of French c\u00f4telettes de volaille, the humerus bone of the wing is left attached. This also holds for their Russian versions and in particular for chicken Kiev. For serving, the bone is usually covered with a frilled paper napkin. However, industrially produced pure fillets are often used nowadays, and the cutlets are served without the bone. This is the usual way of serving chicken Kiev in the US. A spherically shaped version was developed by English chef Jesse Dunford Wood.\n\nConvenience food\nIn the middle of the 20th century, semi-processed ground meat cutlets were introduced in the USSR. Colloquially known as Mikoyan cutlets (named after Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled industrially produced American beef burgers. Some varieties bore names of well known Russian restaurant dishes but they had little in common with the original dishes. In particular, a variety of a pork patty was called \"Kiev-style cutlet\". Since the late Soviet times, \"real\" chicken Kiev cutlets have been offered in Russia as convenience food.Introduced in Britain during 1979, chicken Kiev was Marks & Spencer company's first ready-made meal. It remains popular in the UK, being readily available in supermarkets and served in some restaurant chains. Due to its popularity, it is included in the UK inflation basket which is composed by the Office for National Statistics for calculations of the consumer price inflation indices. The wide popularity of chicken Kiev as a pre-packaged meal led to the term Kiev being applied to various stuffed chicken dishes, such as \"leek-and-bacon Kiev\" or \"cheese-and-ham Kiev\" (the same dish as chicken cordon bleu). Vegetarian Kievs were introduced in the UK in the 1990s, and are popular vegetarian convenience foods.\n\nSimilar dishes\nAmong other dishes similar to chicken Kiev, the aforementioned chicken cordon bleu with a cheese and ham filling instead of butter is particularly popular in the West. The recipe of Kara\u0111or\u0111eva \u0161nicla, a Serbian breaded veal or pork cutlet, was inspired by chicken Kiev.\n\nCultural references\n\"'Chicken Kiev' speech\" is the derisive name coined by William Safire for then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush's speech in Kyiv on 1 August 1991, which opposed independence for Ukraine, cautioning Ukrainians against \"suicidal nationalism\". Bush did what he could diplomatically to keep the Soviet Union together, but on 24 August Ukraine declared independence, and on 1 December Ukrainians voted for it in a national referendum, leading to the USSR's dissolution by December 26.\nIn 2018, a bronze miniature sculpture of chicken Kiev was placed on Horodecki street in Kyiv, near the restaurant \"Chicken Kyiv\". The sculpture became the first of a set of such mini-sculptures depicting famous symbols of Kyiv placed throughout the city as part of an art project.\n\nSee also\nBreaded cutlet\nList of chicken dishes\nList of Russian dishes\nUkrainian cuisine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n\u041f. \u0412. \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432; et al.

Sajji is considered done when it is at the 'rare' stage. It is served with rice that is cooked inside the animal, which is baked in an oven, wrapped around a stone \"tandoor\". Regional varieties are found with subtle differences in flavouring. Notably, in the urban centres of Karachi, Islamabad or Lahore, chicken is used instead of lamb, the sajji is roasted until it is medium or well-done and is served with rice instead of Balochistan's traditional Kaak bread.\n\nSee also\nBalochi cuisine\nTabaheg\nList of chicken dishes\nList of lamb dishes\nList of stuffed dishes\n Food portal\n\nReferences\n\nSami is also a good dish for lunch",

Raclette cheese is historically a dish originating from the canton of Valais in Switzerland. This cheese from Valais benefits from an AOP. Raclette cheese is also a Swiss-type cheese marketed specifically to be used for this dish.\nRaclette is also served as street food, but often with bread instead of potatoes.\n\nHistory\nDishes of melted cheese were mentioned in medieval texts from Swiss convents as early as 1291. Melted cheese was originally consumed by peasants in the mountainous Alpine regions of the cantons of Valais and Fribourg (Switzerland), and Savoie and Haute-Savoie (France). It was then known in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as Bratch\u00e4s or Bratk\u00e4se, \"roasted cheese\". Traditionally, cow herders carried cheese with them when they were moving cows to or from pastures up in the mountains. In the evening, the cheese would be placed next to a campfire for softening, then scraped onto bread. Melting raclette-type cheese in front of a fire is attested in Valais since 1574. Since 1875, the French term raclette is commonly used for this dish. At the 1909 Cantonal Exhibition of Sion, raclette was promoted as a national dish of Valais. Raclette eventually gained national (and international) popularity from the 1964 National Exhibition.In Valais, raclette is typically served with potatoes, cornichons (fermented, pickled cucumbers), pickled onions, black tea, other warm beverages, or Fendant wine. A popular French option is to serve it with white wine, such as Savoy wine, but Riesling and pinot gris are also common. Traditionally, it is consumed with black tea, since a warm beverage is considered to improve digestion.In Switzerland, a scraper continuously serves all in the restaurant from an oven placed in a separated table or near a wood fire. In France, restaurateurs often place a raclette oven directly on the table, in which case the scraping is to be done by the guests.The name of the dish comes from the French verb racles, 'to scrape'. It refers to both the type of cheese and the dish it is served with.\n\nDish\nRaclette is a dish native to parts of Switzerland. The raclette cheese round is heated, either in front of a fire or by a special machine, then scraped onto diners' plates. In at least one traditional Geneva restaurant the solid cheese is impaled on a spike next to the fire so that it drips. Warm plates with two or three slices of boiled new potato are held underneath to catch the drips and served immediately to patrons, whose bill is calculated by the number of servings they eat.Traditionally the melting happens in front of an open fire, with the big piece of cheese facing the heat. One then regularly scrapes off the melting side. Some restaurants that serve raclette use a heat lamp to substitute for the open fire, with the cheese being put under the lamp as the customer orders and the melted cheese scraped off, as in the traditional method. The melted cheese is accompanied by small firm potatoes (Bintje, Charlotte or Raclette varieties), cornichons (gherkins), pickled onions, and dried meat, such as jambon cru/cuit, salami, and viande des Grisons, and to drink, kirsch, black or herbal tea or white wine from a Valais vineyard (a Fendant wine from the Chasselas grape).A modern way of serving raclette involves an electric table-top grill with small pans, known as coupelles, in which slices of raclette cheese are melted. This new way has been used since the 1950s. Generally the grill is surmounted by a hot plate or griddle. In Switzerland the electrical raclette is called \"raclonette\". The device is put in the middle of the table. The cheese is brought to the table sliced, accompanied by platters of boiled or steamed potatoes, other vegetables, and charcuterie (various meats). These are then mixed with potatoes and topped with cheese in the small wedge-shaped coupelles that are placed under the grill to melt and brown the cheese. Alternatively, slices of cheese may be melted and simply poured over food on the plate. The emphasis in raclette dining is on relaxed and sociable eating and drinking, the meal often running to several hours. French and other European supermarkets generally stock both the grill apparatus and ready-sliced cheese and charcuterie selections, especially around Christmas. Restaurants also provide raclette evenings for parties or dinners.\"Vercouline\" is a raclette in which Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage is used. In Franche-Comt\u00e9, the Bleu de Gex (or \"Bleu du Haut Jura\") and Morbier, both PDO, are used as variants.\nExamples of raclettes\n\nSee also\nCulinary Heritage of Switzerland\nFondue, a different

It originated in Yorkshire at least as early as the 19th century.\n\nHistory\nFat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream. An 1859 Charles Dickens story identifies the fat rascal with the singing hinny of Northumberland. A fat rascal could also be baked as a turf cake, a buttery, flat cake baked in a covered pan among the ashes of a peat fire, and the terms fat rascal and turf cake are sometimes used interchangeably. A Yorkshire cookery book of 1973 had plain flour, baking powder, butter and currants as the ingredients. A 1980 Yorkshire cookbook described fat rascals as a means of using leftover pastry, typically consisting of scraps of shortcrust pastry, sugared, sprinkled with currants and rolled into thick flat cakes before baking. Fat rascals, whatever their composition, do not appear to have been widely known outside the Yorkshire region until the 1980s, although there are occasional mentions in other regions, such as in Rye, Sussex in Ford Madox Ford's 1931 memoirs.There is a recipe for fat rascals in a book called \"The Presidents' Cook Book\" by Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks, published in 1968 by Funk and Wagnalls in the USA. They say \"In Edith Roosevelt's most cherished cook book .... is this recipe for hot biscuits.\" This cook book now rests on a shelf in the parlour of Sagamore Hill.\n\nBettys\nA widely recognised version of the fat rascal was introduced by Bettys Caf\u00e9 Tea Rooms in North Yorkshire in 1983. This is a plump, fruity scone with a 'face' made from cherries and almonds based on a rock cake recipe, developed by Helen Frankel, then a buyer and marketing assistant at Bettys.

Apples were the only locally grown fruit in Germany that kept during the winter months, which made baked apples an economical choice for holiday desserts in the Christmas traditions of Germany or as a sweet main dish in cold weather.\n\nPreparation\nThe whole apples once cored can be stuffed with assorted fillings made from chopped almonds, marzipan, raisins, rum, butter, lemon juice, sugar, spices and other ingredients. Some versions are baked in a baking dish with white wine and honey and baked until tender. They are usually served with vanilla custard or ice cream.Apples can be baked on top of a wood stove or in the oven in round enamel cast iron dishes called \"apple schnitzers\". The dish has a spike in the center that cooks the cored apple from the inside out.

One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a 14-year-old assistant waiter, Henri Charpentier, in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Caf\u00e9 de Paris. He was preparing a dessert for the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom (then Prince of Wales), whose guests included a beautiful French girl named Suzette. This story was told by Charpentier himself in Life \u00e0 la Henri, his autobiography, although later contradicted by the Larousse Gastronomique.\n\nIt was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste ... He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Cr\u00eapes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. \"Will you,\" said His Majesty, \"change Cr\u00eapes Princesse to Cr\u00eapes Suzette?\" Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane.\nDifferent sources (like the Larousse Gastronomique) however doubt that Charpentier, rather than the head waiter, was serving the prince, because he would have been too young.  A less fantastical version emerges from Elsie Lee's interview with him in the 1950s. There, Charpentier explained at length that \"his complicated version began as the dish of pancakes with fruit sauce his foster mother made on very special occasions.\" The addition of liqueur was common among chefs in Paris at the time.The other claim states that the dish was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853\u20131924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897, Reichenberg appeared at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the role of a maid, during which she served cr\u00eapes on stage. Monsieur Joseph, owner of Restaurant Marivaux, provided the cr\u00eapes. He decided to flamb\u00e9 the thin pancakes to attract the audience's attention and keep the food warm for the actors consuming them. Joseph was subsequently director of the Paillard Restaurant in Paris and was later with the Savoy Hotel in London.\nIn 1896, Oscar Tschirky published the recipe as \"Pancakes, Casino Style\" with everything in place except the final flamb\u00e9e. Escoffier described Cr\u00eapes Suzette in the English version of his Guide Culinaire in 1907 (French 1903) the same way, also without the final flamb\u00e9e.\nThe dish was already a specialty of the French restaurant Marie's by 1898.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==", "pages": ["Auguste Escoffier", "Butter", "Caf\u00e9 de Paris (Monaco)", "Caramelization", "Claiborne, Craig", "Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise", "Cr\u00eape", "Cr\u00eapes", "Cura\u00e7ao liqueur", "Dessert", "Edward VII of the United Kingdom", "Flamb\u00e9", "France", "French cuisine", "Grammatical gender", "Grand Marnier", "Gueridon service", "Larousse Gastronomique", "Le Guide Culinaire", "Orange (fruit)", "Oscar Tschirky", "Pancake", "Prince of Wales", "Savoy Hotel", "Sugar", "Tangerine", "The Guardian", "Triple sec", "Zest (ingredient)", "Help:IPA/French", "Portal:Food", "Portal:France"]}, "Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine": {"body": "Ham loaf or hamloaf is a baked meat dish, similar to meatloaf, made of ground ham and ground pork and combined with other ingredients to form a loaf like shape.

The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used as a plate. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, herbs, chilies, or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.\nTamale is an anglicized version of the Spanish word tamal (plural: tamales). Tamal comes from the Nahuatl tamalli. The English \"tamale\" is a back-formation from tamales, with English speakers applying English pluralization rules, and thus interpreting the -e- as part of the stem, rather than part of the plural suffix -es.\n\nOrigin\nTamales originated in Mesoamerica as early as 8000 to 5000 BC.The preparation of tamales is likely to have spread from the indigenous cultures in Guatemala and Mexico to the rest of Latin America. According to archaeologists Karl Taube, William Saturno, and David Stuart, tamales may date from around 100 AD. They found pictorial references in the Mural of San Bartolo, in Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala.The Aztec and Maya civilizations, as well as the Olmec and Toltec before them, used tamales as easily portable food for hunting trips, traveling large distances, and nourishing their armies. Tamales were also considered sacred, as they were seen as the food of the gods. The Aztec, Maya, Olmecs, and Toltecs as peoples considered corn as a central part of their cultural identity, so tamales played a large part in their rituals and festivals.\n\nMesoamerica\nAztec\nThe different forms of Tamales eaten and sold in Aztec markets are well documented in the extensive Florentine Codex written by Reverend Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan. In book X he describes how Aztec tamales used a variety of corn for their flour base and were cooked in earth ovens, or olla, which were heated by the steam of dried cane grown and harvested for the express purpose of cooking tamales. Fillings would consist of meat (turkey, fish, frog, axolotl, gopher), fruit, bean, squash seed, turkey egg and even no filling. They would be seasoned with chilis or seeds if they were savory and honey if they were sweet.Tamales also held great religious and spiritual importance within Aztec culture. It was customary for Aztec women to stay up for two to three days cooking tamales before a wedding. (Codex, Book IX). In terms of festivities, the most notable was Uauhquiltamalcualiztli, which was celebrated during the 18th month of the calendar round. The name of the celebration translates to 'The Eating of Tamales Stuffed with Amaranth Greens' and was a celebration of the fire deity Ixcozauhqui. Another significant ritual for the Aztecs was the feast of Atamalcualiztli (eating of water tamales). This ritual, held every eight years for a whole week, was done by eating tamales without any seasoning, spices, or filling, which allowed the maize freedom from being overworked in the usual tamale cooking methods.\n\nMaya (pre-Columbian)\nIn the present day, it is common in certain Maya areas to steam tamales in a spherical vessel known as a tamalero, as opposed to boiling them, this practice has been linked back to the Classic Maya period due to the presence of boiler scale in Classic Maya pottery. The other common method of cooking tamales was on a comal which is a large flat stone, this method is also used to cook tortillas. In addition to the leaves of plantain and banana which are commonly used today, Mayan tamales were commonly wrapped in the leaves of avocado or piper plants, which would be gathered by men during the rainy season. While meat and fish were the customary fillings of tamales of this era, squash seeds and flowers, and greens such as chaya, or chipilin were also common. Fray Diego de Landa Calder\u00f3n also spoke of 'special breads' [tamales] which were used specifically as offerings, with fillings such as deer heart, or quail. Because of the convenience offered by tamales, specific tamales were made for hunters and travelers. These tamales were cooked with extra wood ashes in order to create a hard 'shell' around the tamales when dried, this allowed tamales to keep for up to 20 days.Tamales appear often in ceramic ware from the Mayan Classic era (200\u20131000 CE). The Fenton vase shows a plate of unwrapped tamales being offered as a penance to a powerful Mayan nobleman.\n\nToltec\nWhile the exact origin of tamales has yet to be determined, the oldest people confirmed to have eaten them were the Toltecs, as archaeologists have found fossilized corn husks around the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon in Teotihuacan. (c. 250 BC \u2013 750 CE)\n\nCaribbean\nCuba\nIn Cuba, before the 1959 Revolution, street vendors sold Mexican-style tamales wrapped in corn husks, usually made without any kind of spicy seasoning. Cuban tamales being identical in form to those made in Mexico City suggests they were brought over to Cuba during the period of intense cultural and musical exchange between Cuba and Mexico after the 1920s.A well-known Cuban song from the 1950s, \"Los Tamalitos de Olga\", (a cha-cha-cha sung by Orquesta Arag\u00f3n) celebrated the delicious tamales sold by a street vendor in Cienfuegos. A peculiarly Cuban invention is the dish known as tamal en cazuela, basically consisting of tamale masa with the meat stuffing stirred into the masa, and then cooked in a pot on the stove to form a kind of hearty cornmeal porridge.\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic, guanimo are Dominican tamales stuffed with picadillo. The name guanimo has its origin in the native Ta\u00ednos.\n\nPuerto Rico\nGuanime is a Puerto Rican dish that can be traced back to pre-Columbian times. It consists of corn masa that is stuffed with beans, seafood, nuts, or meat, and then wrapped in corn husks slowly cooked on a grill.\nGuanimes are prepared in a plain version, without the stuffing, and served with stewed salted cod fish. Since the arrival of Europeans, guanimes have lost their stuffing. Contemporary guanimes are made with corn masa seasoned with coconut milk, lard, broth, and annatto, wrapped in a banana leaf or corn husk.\nThe several versions of guanimes can be made with green plantains, cassava, and a sweet version made with sweet plantains and cornmeal.\nThe guanime is also related to the pastel, a root tamale dating to around the same time as the native Ta\u00edno guanimes.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the dish is called a pastelle and is popular in many households during the entire Christmas season and New Year celebrations. It is usually made with cornmeal and filled with cooked, seasoned meat (chicken and beef being the most popular), raisins, olives, capers, and other seasonings. The entire pastelle is wrapped in a banana leaf, bound with twine and steamed. When fully cooked, the banana leaf is removed to reveal the brightly yellow-colored dish. It is often enjoyed as is or along with a meal. The sweet version is called paymee.\n\nCentral America\nBelize\nThe tamale is a staple in Belize, where it is also known as dukunu, a sweet corn tamale that gets its name from the Garifuna people. Dukunus are mostly vegetarian and consist of roasted corn kernels blended with coconut milk as a base. Butter, salt, and sugar are also added. Dukunus filled with different meats are also made.\n\nEl Salvador\nTamales are a traditional dish in El Salvador. Tamales are typically eaten during holidays, like Christmas. Tamales have a corn masa base and are wrapped in banana leaves. They contain fillings like chicken, vegetables, and/or beans. Corn tamales, or tamales de elote, are also popular. Bean tamales, or tamales pisques, are also consumed, typically during Holy Week.\n\nGuatemala\nPre-Columbian Guatemala\nIn the classical times of the Maya of Central America (Guatemala in particular), the great Mayan lords delighted in a baked dough bun during the winter solstice, made of maize mixed with turkey, tepezcuintle (lowland paca) or venison, spices, and chili pepper, among other ingredients.\nThis meal was later integrated into modern Guatemalan traditions. For example, on Christmas Eve, families prepare black, red, or sweet tamales for family and friends to show gratitude. The tamales are often accompanied with chocolate, yolk bread, and punch, and participate in the Mass of Gallo, at midnight.\nIn Guatemala, eating tamales at midnight on December 24 and 31 is customary. Guatemalans also eat tamales for holiday celebrations, birthdays, and baptisms, so the tamale is considered an important dish in the culture of Guatemala.\nGuatemala has many tamale varieties, from the traditional corn-husked tamale called a chuchito, to a sweet version of tamale, which uses the same corn dough, but is seasoned with honey or sugar combined with chocolate, almonds, plums, seeds, and peppers. Tamales are sold in stores and private homes (especially on Saturdays). A red light on a home at night is a sign that tamales are for sale at that home.\n\nVarieties\nRed tamales owe their name to achiote and tomato and are made with corn dough stuffed with recado rojo, raisins, chili peppers, chicken, beef or pork wrapped in banana leaves.\nCambray tamales contain raisins and almonds. Sweet tamales are filled with sweet recado rojo. Black tamales are named after the color that chocolate gives them. Chipilin tamales wrapped in corn husks, parrot tamales, and corn tamales among others are also made. Cream tamales and cheese and anise seeds are also mixed with corn tamales.\nChuchito is a typical and emblematic dish of Guatemala. It is a variation of the tamale made with corn dough, but a firmer consistency, although lard can be added to the dough to generate a more pleasant taste and consistency. It is usually mixed with recado rojo of tomato and with a filling that can be with chicken, beef, or pork. It is wrapped with dried cob leaves (tusa or bender). In some places, it is accompanied by cheese, sauce, or both.\nRice tamales come from the Guatemalan highlands, where the typical corn dough is replaced by a thick dough of annealed rice with water and salt. The preparation of the recado rojo does not differ much from the original, since only some regions have the ingredients with which it is made.\nPaches is a tamale particularly from the highlands of Guatemala that uses potato instead of maize for the dough.\nTamal or tamalito is dough only, with no meats or other fillings. This dish is used to accompany a meal and used to scoop food on the plate, or just eaten plain along with the main dish.\n\nNicaragua\nThe most popular version of the Tamal in Nicaragua is the nacatamal and sometimes serves as an entire meal in itself. It is a traditional dish with indigenous origins. The name comes from the Nawat language spoken by the Nicarao, who were situated on the Southern Pacific coast of Nicaragua, and translates to \"meat tamale\". The nacatamal is perhaps the most produced within traditional Nicaraguan cuisine and it is an event often reserved for Sundays at mid-morning. It is usually eaten together with fresh bread and coffee. Enjoying nacatamales during special occasions and to invite extended family and neighbors to also partake is a common occurrence.\nNacatamales are much larger in size in comparison to their counterparts, and made up of mostly nixtamalized corn masa (a kind of dough traditionally made from a process called nizquezar) and lard). The masa and liquified concoction of onion, garlic, tomato, salt, achiote (annatto), naranja agria and bell pepper is cooked and the result becomes the base for the nacatamal and it is also referred to as masa. This base is ladled onto plantain leaves used for wrapping into large individual portions. The filling usually consists of annatto-seasoned pork meat, rice, slices of potatoes, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions; olives, spearmint sprigs, and chile congo, a very small, egg-shaped chile found in Nicaragua. On occasion, prunes, raisins, or capers can be added. The masa and filling are then wrapped in plantain leaves, tied with a string, and made into pillow-shaped bundles \u2013 nacatamales. They are then steamed or pressure-cooked for several hours. The entire process is very labor-intensive, and it often requires preparation over the course of two days; involving the whole family may be needed to complete it.\n\nVarieties\nPizque Are a much simpler version of a tamal in Nicaragua, they are wrapped in a banana leaf, and are eaten with cheese and cooked red beans.\nPizque Relleno have a sweet flavor, filled with a mixture of ground beans sweetened with cane sugar or rapadura and are wrapped in banana leaves. They serve as a dessert.\nYoltamal Is made with tender corn grains that gives it a slightly sweet flavor and wrapped in corn husks. It is generally eaten accompanied by quesillo or cheese, and sour cream.\nYoltamal Relleno. A variety of the above stuffed with a mixture of rapadura and grated or ground cheese.\nMontucas Neosegovianas y Estelianas. A Northern Nicaraguan tamal make with chicken or hen meat, wrapped in a banana leaf and tied.\nPaco Is a Western Nicaraguan tamal mostly found in Le\u00f3n. that consists of masa mixed with mashed green plantain, sugar, honey and salt. It's wrapped in tempisque or fig leaf and cooked.\n\nPre-Columbian Mayas\nIn the pre-Columbian era, the Mayas ate tamales and often served them at feasts and festivals. The Classic Maya hieroglyph for tamales has been identified on pots and other objects dating back to the Classic Era (200\u20131000 CE), although they likely were eaten much earlier. While tortillas are the basis for the contemporary Maya diet, remarkably little evidence exists for tortilla production among the Classic period Maya.  A lack of griddles in the archaeological record suggests that the primary foodstuff of the Mesoamerican diet may have been the tamal, a cooked, vegetal-wrapped mass of maize dough. Tamales are cooked without the use of ceramic technologies and therefore the form of the tamale is thought to predate the tortilla. Similarities between the two maize products can be found in both the ingredients, preparation techniques, and the linguistic ambiguity exhibited by the pan-Mayan term wa referring to a basic, daily consumed maize product that can refer to either tortillas or tamales.\n\nModern Mexico\nIn Mexico, tamales begin with a dough made from ground nixtamalized corn (hominy), called masa, or alternatively a rehydrated masa powder, such as Maseca. It is combined with lard or vegetable shortening, along with broth or water, to bring the dough to the consistency of a very thick batter. It is traditional to whisk the lard, and whisk the resulting batter, with the intent of producing the signature soft and fluffy texture. Modern recipes may use baking powder to achieve a similar effect. Chili purees or dried chili powders are also occasionally added to the batter, which in addition to the spice can cause some tamales to appear red in color. Tamales are generally wrapped in corn husks or plantain leaves before being steamed, with the choice of husk depending on the region. They usually have a sweet or savory filling and are usually steamed until firm.\nTamale-making is a ritual that has been part of Mexican life since pre-Hispanic times, when special fillings and forms were designated for each specific festival or life event. Today, tamales are typically filled with meats, cheese, or vegetables, especially chilies. Preparation is complex and time-consuming, and an excellent example of Mexican communal cooking, where this task usually falls to the women. Tamales are a favorite comfort food in Mexico, eaten as both breakfast and dinner, and often accompanied by hot atole or champurrado and arroz con leche (rice porridge, \"rice with milk\") or maize-based beverages of indigenous origin. Street vendors can be seen serving them from huge, steaming, covered pots (tamaleras) or ollas.\nInstead of corn husks, banana or plantain leaves are used in tropical parts of the country, such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. These tamales are rather square in shape, often very large\u201415 inches (40 cm)\u2014and these larger tamales are commonly known as pibs in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Another very large type of tamale is zacahuil, made in the Huasteca region of Mexico. Depending on the size, zacahuil can feed between 50 and 200 people; they are made during festivals and holidays, for quincea\u00f1eras, and on Sundays to be sold at the markets.\n\nSouth America\nHumitas (from Quechua humint'a) is a Native South American dish from pre-Hispanic times, a traditional food from the Andes and it can be found in Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, and Northwest Argentina. It consists of fresh choclo (Peruvian corn) pounded to a paste, wrapped in a fresh corn husk, and slowly steamed or boiled in a pot of water. In Bolivia it is known as huminta and in Brazil as pamonha.\n\nVenezuela\nHallaca is a traditional meal from Venezuela that resembles the aspect of a tamal. It consists of corn dough stuffed with a stew of beef, pork, or chicken and other ingredients such as raisins, capers, and olives, fresh onion rings, red and green bell pepper slices. There are also vegetarian options with black beans or tofu. Hallacas are folded in plantain leaves, tied with strings, and boiled. The dish is traditionally served during the Christmas season and has several regional variants in Venezuela. It has been described as a national dish of Venezuela but it can be found also in variants. A characteristic of the hallaca is the delicate corn dough made with consomm\u00e9 or broth and lard colored with annatto.\n\nPeru\nTamales were one of the dishes that the gay, Peruvian chef Juan Jos\u00e9 Cabezudo was famous for serving from his food stand near the Plaza Mayor in Lima.\n\nPhilippines and Guam\nIn the Philippines and Guam, which were governed by Spain as a province of Mexico, different forms of tamale-like foods exist. In the Philippines, they merged with the native leaf-wrapped rice cakes (kakanin) and are made with a dough derived from ground rice and are filled with seasoned chicken or pork with the addition of peanuts and other seasonings such as sugar.  In some places, such as Pampanga, where it is popularly known as bobotu, and Batangas provinces, the tamales are wrapped in banana leaves, but sweet corn varieties from the Visayas region are wrapped in corn husks similar to the sweet corn tamales of the American Southwest and Mexico.  Because of the work involved in the preparation of tamales, they usually only appear during the special holidays or other big celebrations.  Various tamal recipes have practically disappeared under the pressures of modern life and the ease of fast food.  Several varieties of tamales are also found in the Philippines.Tamales, tamalis, tamalos, and pasteles are different varieties found throughout the region. Some are sweet, some are savory, and some are sweet and savory. Mostly wrapped in banana leaves and made of rice, either the whole grain or ground and cooked with coconut milk and other seasonings, they are sometimes filled with meat and seafood, or are plain and have no filling.  There are certain varieties, such as tamalos, that are made of a sweet corn masa wrapped in a corn husk or leaf. There are also varieties made without masa, like tamalis, which are made with small fish fry wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, similar to the tamales de charal from Mexico, where the small fish are cooked whole with herbs and seasonings wrapped inside a corn husk without masa. The number of varieties has dwindled through the years so certain types of tamales that were once popular in the Philippines have become lost or are simply memories.  The variety found in Guam, known as tamales guiso, is made with corn masa and wrapped in corn husks, and as with the Philippine tamales, are clear evidence of the influence of the galleon trade that occurred between the ports of Manila and Acapulco.\n\nUnited States\nWhile Mexican-style and other Latin American-style tamales are featured at ethnic restaurants throughout the United States, some distinctly indigenous styles also are made.\nThe Choctaw and Chickasaw make a dish called banaha, which can be stuffed or not (plain). Usually, the filling (ranging from none, fried bacon, turkey, deer, nuts, and vegetables such as onions, potatoes, squash, and sweet potatoes) can either be filled or mixed with the masa and steamed in a corn husk.\nCherokee tamales, also known as bean bread or \"broadswords\", were made with hominy (in the case of the Cherokee, the masa was made from corn boiled in water treated with wood ashes instead of lime) and beans, and wrapped in green corn leaves or large tree leaves and boiled, similar to the meatless pre-Columbian bean and masa tamales still prepared in Chiapas, central Mexico, and Guatemala.\nIn northern Louisiana, tamales have been made for several centuries. The Spanish established presidio Los Adaes in 1721 in modern-day Robeline, Louisiana. The descendants of these Spanish settlers from central Mexico were the first tamale makers to arrive in the eastern US. Zwolle, Louisiana, has a Tamale Fiesta every year in October.\nIn the Mississippi Delta, African Americans developed a spicy tamale called the hot tamale that is made from cornmeal instead of masa and is boiled in corn husks.Tamales have been eaten in the broader United States since at least 1893, when they were featured at the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1894, when tamales were the most popular ethnic food in Los Angeles, XLNT Foods started making them. The company is the oldest continuously operating Mexican food brand in the United States, and one of the oldest companies in Southern California.A tradition of roving tamale sellers was documented in early 20th-century blues music. They are the subject of the well-known 1937 blues/ragtime song \"They're Red Hot\" by Robert Johnson.\n\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, the name \"tamale pie\" was given to meat pies and casseroles made with a cornmeal crust and typical tamale fillings arranged in layers. Although characterized as Mexican food, these forms are not popular in Mexican American culture in which the individually wrapped style is preferred.The Indio International Tamale Festival held every December in Indio, California, has earned two Guinness World Records: the largest tamale festival (154 000 in attendance, December  2002) and the world's largest tamale, over one foot (0.3 m) in diameter and 40 feet (12.2 m) in length, created by Chef John Sedlar, since beaten by H. Ayuntamiento de Centro Villahermosa (Mexico) in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, on 25 November 2018. The current record stands at 50.05 m. The 2006 Guinness book calls the festival \"the world's largest cooking and culinary festival\".\n\nSee also\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["A Christmas Carol", "A Visit from St. Nicholas",

While there are regional variations for the recipe, the most common way of preparing creier pane is boiling the organ and then coating it evenly in flour, egg and breadcrumbs before deep-frying it in oil. There are many traditional Romanian dishes based entirely on offal. The literal translation for Creier pane is Romanian breaded brain. The word pane come from French pan\u00e9.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==", "pages": ["Afinat\u0103", "Alivenci", "Amandine (dessert)", "Ardei umplu\u021bi", "Arpaca\u0219", "Balmo\u0219", "Borscht", "Bor\u0219 (bran)", "Bor\u0219 de burechiu\u0219e", "Brag\u0103", "Brain (food)", "Breaded", "Bryndza", "Br\u00e2nzoaic\u0103", "Br\u00e2nz\u0103 de burduf", "Br\u00e2nz\u0103 de co\u0219ule\u021b", "Caisat\u0103", "Caltabo\u0219", "Ca\u0219", "Ca\u0219caval", "Ca\u0219caval pane", "Chec", "Chiftele", "Cimbru", "Ciorb\u0103", "Ciorb\u0103 de burt\u0103", "Ciorb\u0103 de peri\u0219oare", "Ciorb\u0103 de pe\u0219te", "Ciorb\u0103 de pui", "Ciorb\u0103 \u021b\u0103r\u0103neasc\u0103", "Cire\u0219at\u0103", "Ciulama", "Cocolo\u0219i", "Colaci", "Coliv\u0103", "Col\u021buna\u0219i", "Cornat\u0103", "Cornule\u021be", "Covrigi", "Cozonac", "Crenvur\u0219t", "Cuisine of Romania", "C\u00e2rna\u021bi", "Deviled egg", "Drob", "Egg (food)", "Emmental cheese", "Fasole b\u0103tut\u0103", "Fasole cu c\u00e2rna\u021bi", "French language", "French toast", "Frig\u0103rui", "Ghiudem", "Ghiveci", "Gogo\u0219i", "Halva", "Horilka", "Hrean", "Joffre cake", "Kabanos", "Kamasutra (chocolate)", "Kishka (food)", "Kompot", "K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs", "Lapte de pas\u0103re", "Lebar", "Leek soup", "Leu\u0219tean", "Limb\u0103 cu m\u0103sline", "Lipie (bread)", "L\u00e1ngos", "Magiun of Topoloveni", "Main course", "Mastika", "Melci\u0219ori", "Mititei", "Mucenici", "Mujdei", "Mur\u0103turi", "Musaca", "M\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103", "M\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103 in paturi", "Nechezol", "N\u0103dlac sausages", "N\u0103sal cheese", "Orez cu lapte", "Ostropel", "Palatschinke", "Papana\u0219i", "Paprica\u0219", "Paska (bread)", "Pastram\u0103", "Penteleu", "Piftie", "Pilaf", "Pit\u0103 de Pecica", "Plachie", "Ple\u0219coi sausages", "Pl\u0103cint\u0103", "Potato salad", "Processed cheese", "P\u00e1linka", "P\u00e2rjoale", "Rahat (confectionery)", "Rakia", "Rasol (Romanian dish)", "Romanian cuisine", "Romanian language", "R\u00e2nta\u0219", "Salat\u0103 de boeuf", "Salat\u0103 de vinete", "Saramur\u0103", "Sarmale", "Scorcolga", "Scovard\u0103", "Sec\u0103ric\u0103", "Semolina pudding", "Sfin\u021bi\u0219ori", "Sibiu Salami", "Sl\u0103nin\u0103", "Sm\u00e2nt\u00e2n\u0103", "Socat\u0103", "Sot\u00e9 de morcovi", "S\u00e2ngerete", "Taramasalata", "Telemea", "Tob\u0103", "Tocan\u0103", "Tochitur\u0103", "Tur\u021b", "Urd\u0103", "Urs de m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103", "Varz\u0103 c\u0103lit\u0103", "Vinars", "Vi\u0219inat\u0103", "V\u0103rzar", "Wheat", "Yahni", "Zacusc\u0103", "Zmeurat\u0103", "\u0218ni\u021bel", "\u0218odou", "\u0218trudel", "\u0218unc\u0103", "\u021auic\u0103", "Wikipedia:Citing sources", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Template:Cuisine of Romania", "Template:Romanian cheeses", "Template:Romanian delicatessen", "Template talk:Cuisine of Romania", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles lacking sources from November 2015", "Portal:Food", "Portal:Romania"]}, "Category:Articles needing additional references from February 2023": {"body": "Kopytka (literally \"little hooves\") are a kind of potato dumpling in Polish, Belarusian, and Lithuanian cuisines.

The Polish dish is usually cooked in salted water, whereas in Belarusian and Lithuanian cuisines kapytki is baked first, then stewed or boiled in water.\nKopytka can be either a main dish or served on the side. Kopytka can be served savoury (baked with cheese, fried bacon, fried onion, or with a variety of sauces such as goulash or mushroom sauce); they can also be served sweet (with melted butter and sugar, cinnamon, or sweetened quark), or sugar with sour cream.\n\nEtymology\nThe word kopytka [kopyto \"hoof\", kopytko \"little hoof\", neuter singular nouns] is Polish for \"little hooves,\" such as those of a small hoofed animal (for example, a goat). Kapytki is the Belarusian word for the same concept.

It is made by simmering milk on low heat for eight hours or longer.\n\nHistory\nBaked milk was relatively popular outside of Russia as well. It was deemed more palatable than boiled milk, and was described in medical literature as potentially more digestible. The most simple recipe suggested by 19th-century cookbooks for baked milk instructed one to leave milk in an oven overnight; however more elaborate recipes could be found as well.In rural areas, baked milk has been produced by leaving a jug of boiled milk in an oven for a day or overnight until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes reactions between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting in the formation of melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. The stove in a traditional Russian loghouse (izba) sustains \"varying cooking temperatures based on the placement of the food inside the oven\".Today, baked milk is produced on an industrial scale. Like scalded milk, it is free of bacteria and enzymes and can be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours. Home-made baked milk is used for preparing a range of cakes, pies, and cookies.\nLong term consumption of baked milk may help for resolution of milk allergy. However, in some cases, acquired tolerance reverts back to unresolved allergy.\n\nFermented baked milk\nRyazhenka and varenets are fermented baked milk products, a type of traditional yoghurt. It is a common breakfast drink in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.\nIn peasant communities, varenets has been made in the traditional East Slavic oven by \"baking sour milk to a golden brown color\". In the Soviet era, the name \"ryazhenka\" came to be applied to a government-produced creme-colored drink without the skin.\n\nSee also\nCaramelized sweetened condensed milk, or dulce de leche, is a similar preparation used in home-made pastries, often prepared by prolonged heating of unopened cans of condensed milk.\nList of baked goods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Baked milk at Wikimedia Commons", "pages": ["A2 milk", "Amino acids", "Anijsmelk", "Bacteria", "Bag-in-box", "Belarus", "Belarusian language", "Boiling", "Breast milk", "Breast milk jewelry", "Breastfeeding", "Buffalo milk", "Butter", "Buttermilk", "Camel milk", "Carbonated milk", "Cheese", "Chocolate milk", "Coffee milk", "Colostrum", "Condensed milk", "Cream", "Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche", "Curd", "Custard", "Dairy", "Doi (identifier)", "Donkey milk", "Doogh", "Dulce de leche", "Enzyme", "Evaporated milk", "Fidel Castro and dairy", "Filled milk", "Filmj\u00f6lk", "Flavored milk", "Ghee", "Glass milk bottle", "Goat milk", "Haymilk", "Heat", "ISBN (identifier)", "Ice cream", "Ice milk", "Izba", "Jug", "Kefir", "Kumis", "Lactation", "List of baked goods", "Maillard reaction", "Malted milk", "Mare milk", "Melanoidin", "Milk", "Milk allergy", "Milk bag", "Milk carton", "Milk churn", "Milk crate", "Milk delivery", "Milk quotas in the United Kingdom", "Milk sugar", "Milking", "Milking pipeline", "Milkmaid", "Milkman", "Milkshake", "Moose milk", "Organic milk", "PMC (identifier)", "PMID (identifier)", "Pasteurized milk", "Pig milk", "Plastic milk container", "Powdered milk", "Raw milk", "Russia", "Russian language", "Russian stove", "Ryazhenka", "Scalded milk", "Sheep milk", "Simmering", "Skimmed milk", "Skyr", "Sour cream", "Soured milk", "Square milk jug", "Tetra Brik", "Toned milk", "Ukraine", "Ukrainian language", "Ultra-high-temperature processing", "Ultrafiltered milk", "Vanilla milk", "Varenets", "Whey", "Witch's milk", "World Milk Day", "Ymer (dairy product)", "Yoghurt", "Yogurt", "Template:Cite book", "Template:Cite journal", "Template:Milk navbox", "Template talk:Milk navbox", "Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher", "Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Category:Milk"]}, "Category:Oysters": {"body": "Oysters Bienville is a traditional dish in New Orleans cuisine of baked oysters in a shrimp sauce.

It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan, a rectangular Kastenpickert, or a palm-sized regular Pickert. The name is derived from Low German picken, pecken (\"to stick something onto something else\").\nThe main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10\u201315 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4\u20135 people.\nPickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields. They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or leberwurst.A related dish, Lappenpickert, is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards M\u00fcnster and the Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of sweet cream added. Lappenpickert is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or cold cuts.\n\nSee

the Netherlands, pom is the most popular and best-known festive dish.\nWithin the Surinamese community pom is frequently referred to as a dish of Creole or Jewish origin. It was introduced by the Portuguese\u2013Jewish plantation owners as the Portuguese potato (\"pomme de terre\") oven dish. Because the potato did not grow in Suriname and had to be imported, it was soon replaced with the root of the tayer plant. Pom combines three central ingredients: chicken, citrus juice and pomtajer (Xanthosoma sagittifolium). Only the latter is indigenous, and although all plant parts are edible, only the underground part of the main stem is used as an ingredient in preparing pom. The main stem or corm is most frequently designated as pomtajer or pongtaya (lit. the tajer/taya for pom).\nThe first published description of pom comes from the Encyclopedie van Nederlandsch West-Indi\u00eb (1914\u20131917) which describes the dish as follows: \u2018the big tajer, of which the stalk grows above the earth, is grated and treated with the juice of bitter oranges, afterwards with chicken or fish, made into a pie, which dish is known as pom.\u2019\nThe basic preparation method is saut\u00e9ed chicken pieces between two layers of raw, grated pomtajer, mixed with citrus juice and a sauce made from oil or margarine, onions, tomatoes, salt, pepper and nutmeg, baked in an oven until the pom becomes golden brown.\nIn Amsterdam alone there are over 120 establishments serving Surinamese food. Other Dutch cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague have a growing number of caterers, eateries and take-aways. Most establishments serve pom, and often also \u201cbroodje pom\u201d (pom on a bread roll), a derivation of the national dish. In particular, \u201cbroodje pom\u201d is rapidly gaining popularity and starting to appear on the Dutch menu. It can sometimes even be ordered in Dutch take-aways and for home delivery. In recent years, more and more recipes for pom have appeared in Dutch cookbooks, newspapers and on websites. In 2007, an exhibition about pom was held at Imagine Identity and Culture, an Amsterdam-based centre for the representation of migration and cultures as seen from their own perspective.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nVaneker, Karin. 2009.

Potatoes are peeled and sliced very thin. The slices, salted and peppered, are layered into a pan (see below), generously doused with clarified butter, and baked until they form a cake. Then the cake is flipped every ten minutes until the outside is golden and crisp. At the end of the cooking period, the dish is unmoulded and forms a cake 15 to 20 centimetres (6 to 8 in) in diameter and about five centimetres (2 in) high. It is then cut in wedges and served immediately on a hot plate, usually accompanying roasted meats.\nA special double baking dish made of copper called la cocotte \u00e0 pommes Anna is still manufactured in France for the cooking of this dish. It consists of upper and lower halves which fit into each other so that the whole vessel with its contents can be inverted during cooking.\n\nHistory\nThe dish is generally credited with having been created during the time of Napoleon III by the chef Adolphe Dugl\u00e9r\u00e9, a pupil of Car\u00eame, when Dugl\u00e9r\u00e9 was head chef at the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, the leading Paris restaurant of the 19th century, where he reputedly named the dish for one of the grandes cocottes of the period. There is disagreement about which beauty the dish was named after: the actress Anna Judic  or Anna Deslions.

The dish originated at a chip shop in Scotland as a novelty item. Since various mass media began reporting on the practice in the mid-1990s \u2013 often as a critical commentary on how unhealthy the Scottish diet was \u2013 the popularity of the dish has spread.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish is prepared using standard commercial Mars bars. The chocolate bar is typically chilled before battering, to prevent it from excessively melting as it is fried. It is coated in flour batter of the type commonly used for deep-frying fish, sausages, and other similar foods, then immersed in boiling fat or oil, until the batter is cooked.\n\nOrigin\nThe origins of the deep-fried Mars bar are disputed. John Davie claimed to have invented it in 1992 in The Haven Chip Bar (now The Carron) in Stonehaven, near Aberdeen on Scotland's northeast coast. It received rapidly escalating media attention after Aberdeen Evening Express writer Alastair Dalton reported on 23 August 1995, \"HOT chocolate has become this summer's sizzler in Stonehaven chip shop. Mars Bars, deep-fried in batter, are being snapped up by sweet-toothed teenagers. The craze started when the school holidays began and has quickly taken hold says Ingram Mowatt (41), owner of The Haven, Allardice Terrace. \" The article included a quote from a Mars spokesperson, who said this was the most unusual way they had come across of enjoying a Mars bar. The following day the story was picked up and run in the Daily Record in an article titled \"Mars supper, please\".Scottish broadsheets The Herald and The Scotsman ran the story the following day, and the UK broadsheets the day after, each adding their own cultural slant. On the fifth day, Keith Chegwin performed taste tests on The Big Breakfast TV programme and the story was covered by the BBC World Service.\nOther chip shops have disputed Carron's claim. Tom Cummings, the former owner of Duncan Street Chip Shop in Banff, stated that he had sold fried Mars bars in the 1980s, and he had copied the recipe from the since defunct Dodie's Chip Shop in Buckie on the Moray Firth coast.\n\nPopularity\nAfter the food was mentioned in 2004 by Jay Leno on NBC's Tonight Show in the United States, The Lancet commissioned the University of Dundee to validate the association between Scotland and the deep-fried Mars bar. It undertook a telephone questionnaire survey of 627 fish and chip shops in Scotland, 62% of which responded, and found:\n66 shops (22% of those responding) sold them; three-quarters of those had only been selling them for the past 3 years.\nAn additional 17% had sold them in the past.\nAverage sales were 23 bars per week, although 10 shops reported selling 50\u2014200 per week.\nThe mean price was \u00a30.60 (range \u00a30.30 to \u00a31.50).\n76% were sold to children.\n15 shops reported health concerns with the food.\nMany of the shops which did not sell the product refused to do so as it turns the frying oil black.In 2012, the originating Carron Fish Bar estimated sales of 100\u2013150 deep-fried Mars bars per week, but 70% were sold to visitors who have heard of its reputation.\n\nCulinary influence\nIn 2000, Scottish chef Ross Kendall included the bars on the menu of Le Chipper restaurant in Paris.The deep-fried Mars bar has also given rise to the frying of other confections, for example, Reiver's Fish Bar in Duns annually advertises an Easter special of deep-fried Creme Egg. Deep-fried Snickers have also been reported; it is popular at state fairs and similar events. In her 1999 book and television series Nigella Bites, Nigella Lawson includes a recipe for a deep-fried Bounty bar. Deep-fried Moro bars are also sold in New Zealand, where the brand is popular.\n\nSymbol of an unhealthy diet\nSince the Daily Record described it as \"Scotland's craziest takeaway\" in August 1995, the deep-fried Mars bar has become a symbol for ill health, obesity and high-fat diets. The original article was quickly followed up by other UK publications, with the food portrayed to speak eloquently about Scotland's and the wider UK's poor diet, and resultant levels of obesity.In 2012, the Haven sought an application for the protected geographical indication under the EU's Protected Food Name Scheme. However, Mars wrote to the fish bar asking it to make plain that deep-frying of the bars was \"not authorised or endorsed\" by Mars, and an agreed disclaimer statement was put up in both the shop and in its menu.In a 2012 interview, Glasgow restaurateur John Quigley felt that Scotland had been trying to \"shake off\" its unhealthy image for 20 years, since the media coverage of the deep-fried Mars bar.\n\nSee also\nDeep-fried Twinkie\nDeep-fried pizza\nFried ice cream\nBaked Alaska\nList of deep-fried foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Deep-fried Mars Bars at Wikimedia Commons\n Deep Fried Mars Bar at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject\nCBS NewsThe page cannot be foundThe page may have been removed, had its name changed, or is just temporarily unavailable.\n\nDeep-Fried Candy Bars: Scotland's Worst Food?

Introduced in 1965 by General Foods, it is currently made under the Kraft Heinz brand.\n\nConcept\nShake 'n Bake provides a baked alternative to foods fried in oil. The product is applied by placing raw meat or vegetable pieces in a bag containing the coating, closing the bag, and shaking it so the coating adheres to the pieces. They are then placed on a baking sheet and cooked in an oven. Shake 'n Bake has been marketed as a healthier and less-greasy alternative to frying, with slogans such as, \"Shake 'n Bake: It's better than frying\", and \"Why fry? Shake 'n Bake\".\n\nIngredients\nShake 'n Bake Original Pork flavor contains the following ingredients: enriched wheat flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamin mononitrate Vitamin B1, riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid), salt, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, sugar, contains less than 2% of paprika, dextrose, dried onions, spice, caramel color, yeast, annatto (color), and natural flavor. Barbecue flavor Shake 'n Bake includes sugar, maltodextrin, salt, modified food starch, spice, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, brown sugar, mustard seed flour, dried onions, dried tomatoes, dried garlic, beet powder (color), citric acid, natural flavor, caramel color, vinegar, and sodium silicoaluminate as an anticaking agent.\n\nAdvertisements\nShake 'n Bake is particularly noted for its television commercials in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, starring such child actors as Carrie Jean Cochran, Carly Schroeder, Taylor Momsen, and Philip Amelio. In the ads, the aforementioned children help make Shake 'n Bake with their mothers, enthusiastically exclaiming, \"And I helped!\"\nIn the 70s, Shake 'N Bake had a line of advertisements featuring a butcher named Pete The Butcher who constantly promotes Shake 'N Bake to his customers. Pete the Butcher was played by John Braden. In 1981 one of his ads included Ann B. Davis, who played Alice the housekeeper on The Brady Bunch. The ad copy includes the catchphrases, \"Gotta be crispy, gotta be golden, gotta be juicy\", and, \"You just shake then bake, and that chicken's so crisp and juicy and golden it makes me look golden, if you know what I mean\".In 1990, two commercials were produced which show what pork chops and chicken look like after frying. They then show that pork chops and chicken are crispier, juicier, more plump, and more tender when used with Shake n' Bake than when fried. They conclude with, \"Why fry? Shake n' Bake\".\nIn 1998, a new commercial was tried with a different catchphrase: \"Mama made Shake 'n Bake, and I helped\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website", "pages": ["800 Westchester Avenue", "A.1.

It is made for the Orthodox Christian celebration of Slava, a UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The parish priest visits the family to consecrate the kola\u010d and red wine, and to light a beeswax candle stamped with an image of the saint.Often extended family and friends are invited to the celebration. Wine is poured over the cake, and it is cut or broken by members of the family before lunch.\n\nSignificance\nThe custom of Slava and the importance of the celebration cake are found only among Serbs. It celebrates home liturgy, domesticity, family gatherings, and family tradition. Slavski kola\u010d, along with the candle and a wheat dish such as \u017eito (koljivo), are present at all Slava celebrations and are considered the crucial elements.The cake symbolizes of the body of Jesus, and the wine with which the cake is eaten represents his blood. Traditionally a woman made the bread the day before the celebration, after bathing, dressing in clean clothing, saying the Lord's Prayer, and crossing herself. Tradition calls for the dough to be made with consecrated water.During the coronavirus pandemic, health authorities advised that it was not necessary to take the cake to church, that singing was not necessary for the celebration, and that the gatherings should be limited to household members.\n\nDescription\nThe kola\u010d is a round yeast breadlike cake approximately 15 centimetres (6 in) high. Traditionally, braided dough is wrapped around the rim and a dough cross is pressed into the center of the dough, dividing the loaf into quarters. Each quarter gets further decoration, such a Cyrillic \"C\", which stands for samo, sloga, Srbina, spasava, meaning \"Only unity will save the Serbs\". Around the rim the letters \"\u0418\u0421 \u0425\u0421 \u041d\u0418 \u041a\u0410\" (Cyrillic), an abbreviation for \"Jesus Christ Conquers\". Every baker has her own style of decoration.\n\nConsecration\nThe parish priest visits the family to consecrate the kola\u010d and red wine, and to light a beeswax candle stamped with an image of the saint. Some families instead take the cake to church to be consecrated.After the cake is consecrated, wine is poured over the cake. The woman of the household cuts it into quarters and turns it cut-side up. It is further cut into pieces by other family members and oldest or most important guests.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nPatron saint day\nKolach (bread)\nKorovai\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Architecture of Serbia", "Art of Serbia", "Balkan Insight", "COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia", "Christianity in Serbia", "Cinema of Serbia", "Coat of arms of Serbia", "Cuisine of Serbia", "Cultural Heritage of Serbia", "Culture of Serbia", "Danas (newspaper)", "Ethnic groups in Serbia", "Festivals of Serbia", "Flag of Serbia", "Folklore of Serbia", "Hinduism in Serbia", "History of Serbia", "History of the Jews in Serbia", "ISBN (identifier)", "Indiana University Press", "Islam in Serbia", "Jesus", "Ju\u017ene vesti", "Kolach (bread)", "Kolach (cake)", "Korovai", "Languages of Serbia", "List of Serbian Orthodox monasteries", "List of Serbian composers", "List of Serbian monarchs", "List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia", "List of fortifications in Serbia", "List of palaces and manor houses in Serbia", "Literature of Serbia", "Matica srpska", "Media in Serbia", "Monuments of Serbia", "Music of Serbia", "Mythology of Serbia", "National Museum of Serbia", "National anthem of Serbia", "Novosti AD", "Old Church Slavonic", "Organisations of Serbia", "Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church", "Patron saint day", "Performing art of Serbia", "Protestantism in Serbia", "Radio in Serbia", "Religion in Serbia", "Roman Catholicism in Serbia", "Serbia in the Middle Ages", "Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts", "Serbian Cyrillic alphabet", "Serbian Orthodox Church", "Serbian comics", "Serbian cuisine", "Serbian dances", "Serbian dress", "Serbian epic poetry", "Serbian heraldry", "Serbian kinship", "Serbian language", "Serbs", "Sign of the cross", "Slava (tradition)", "Sport in Serbia", "Stil Magazin", "Symbols of Serbia", "Telegraf.rs", "Television in Serbia", "The Spruce Eats", "Traditions of Serbia", "UNESCO", "\u017dito (koljivo)", "Template:Culture of Serbia", "Template:Serbia topics", "Template talk:Culture of Serbia", "Category:Museums in Serbia", "Category:Serbia", "Category:Serbian actors", "Category:Serbian composers", "Category:Serbian painters", "Category:Serbian sculptors", "Category:Serbian writers", "Category:Theatres in Serbia", "Portal:Serbia"]}, "Turkey": {"body": "So\u011fan kebab\u0131 (Onion kebab) is a Turkish kebab dish made with ground lamb kofte baked inside sliced onions, peppers and pomegranate sauce.The dish comes from the Gaziantep region of Southern Turkey, close to the Syrian border.

boiled together, along with flour dumplings known as \"doughboys\".\n\nOrigins\nIn Polynesian cuisine, food was boiled in wooden bowls into which a red-hot stone was dropped. This was sufficient for heating liquids and pastes, but was insufficient to cook taro or pork; those foods were usually baked in an earth oven. The M\u0101ori carried these traditions to Aotearoa (New Zealand), making puddings of grated k\u016bmara (called roroi) or mashed kiekie flower bracts in large wooden bowls.When P\u0101keh\u0101 settlers arrived from Europe, they brought with them new foods and iron cooking pots. Pigs and potatoes from Europe were rapidly adopted by M\u0101ori, who produced large quantities for trading with the settlers. As settler housing did not have the built-in coal ranges and ovens of Regency Britain, most cooking was done on a hearth, in a cast-iron three-legged cauldron or camp oven. Camp ovens were imported in their hundreds from the 1850s, and were popular with M\u0101ori: they could be transported by waka or carried, and could stand on three feet in the embers or be hung by a chain. Camp ovens were used for making flour-and-sugar puddings, baking traditional r\u0113wena bread, and for the first pork-and-potato boil ups.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Aotearoa", "Bile up", "Bract", "Cabbage", "Cauldron", "Doi (identifier)", "Dumplings", "Dutch oven", "Earth oven", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "JSTOR (identifier)", "Kiekie (plant)", "M\u0101ori cuisine", "New Zealand", "PMID (identifier)", "Polynesian cuisine", "Pork", "Potato", "P\u0101keh\u0101 settlers", "Regency era", "R\u0113wena", "S2CID (identifier)", "Sonchus", "Soup", "Stock (food)", "Sweet potato", "Taro", "Watercress", "Template:Cite journal", "Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list", "Category:Use New Zealand English from April 2020", "Category:Use dmy dates from April 2020"]}, "Category:Articles with dead external links from August 2017": {"body": "A crab boil is a social event where boiled crabs are eaten, a kind of seafood boil.\n\nLouisiana and New Orleans\nBoiled seafood in southern Louisiana tends to be spicier than that found in other parts of the country.

Boiled dressing is easier for less skilled cooks to make from scratch, and liquid food oils needed to make mayonnaise were not readily available in Northern Europe and the United States in the 19th century. Mayonnaise was not available for retail purchase until 1912.\n\nPreparation\nThere are many variations of boiled dressing, and common ingredients include vinegar, sugar or honey, milk or cream, eggs or egg yolks, salt, mustard, cayenne and flour. Sometimes, the dressing is actually boiled but more often, it is gently cooked over boiling water in a double boiler. It was used in salads like cole slaw, chicken salad, potato salad and egg salad.\n\nTypes\nSalad cream, a product popular in the United Kingdom, is a type of boiled dressing developed by Heinz in 1914.

The article included a recipe for a boiled dressing recommended for use in chicken salad or fruit salad.Culinary writer M.F.K. Fisher preferred mayonnaise  to boiled dressing, because she associated boiled dressing with her grandmother's old fashioned insistence on using it on lettuce.

Hot tamales are smaller than the tamales found in Hispanic America and their recipes vary significantly from chef to chef. The most common meat is ground beef or pork, but some chefs use turkey or even venison if brought in by customers.\n\nHistory\nWhile the exact history of the hot tamale is unknown, there are several competing theories to explain its origin. One theory suggests that the meal dates back to the food prepared by Native Americans of the Mississippi delta. Another posits that it was brought back by soldiers returning from the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s. The final theory holds that the meal was created in the early 20th century when African Americans adapted the tamales prepared by Mexican migrant workers, which is believed by local historians to be the most likely origin.\n\nHot Tamale Trail\nThe \"Hot Tamale Trail\", a collection of restaurants and eateries that serve hot tamales, was created as a result of the documentation of the hot tamale by the Southern Foodways Alliance in the early 2000s. Local restaurants in Rosedale, Cleaveland, Greenville, and Vicksburg can be found along the trail.

Fully mature peanuts do not make good quality boiled peanuts; rather, raw or green ones are used.  Raw denotes peanuts in a semi-mature state, having achieved full size but not being fully dried, as would be needed for roasting or peanut butter use. Green denotes freshly harvested and undried peanuts that must be refrigerated. After boiling in salt water they take on a strong salty taste, becoming softer with prolonged cooking, and somewhat resembling a pea or bean, to which they are related because they are legumes and a nut only in the culinary sense.\nThe most flavorful peanuts for boiling are the Valencia type. These are preferred in the United States, being grown in gardens and small patches throughout the South. Green Virginia-type peanuts are also sometimes used.\n\nRegional variations\nSouthern United States\nBoiled peanuts are widely consumed and commercially available in an area of the Southern United States from North Carolina, south to central Florida, as far north as Ohio, and west to Mississippi.  The peanuts are sold in the hull and boiled with only salt or with a piquant spice mixture such as Old Bay or Zatarain's.  The latter are often called \"Cajun boiled peanuts\" in many recipes.\n\nHistory\nBoiling peanuts has been a folk cultural practice in the Southern United States, where they were originally called goober peas, since at least the 19th century.  The practice of eating boiled peanuts was likely brought by enslaved black people from West Africa, where the related bambara groundnut is a traditional staple crop.:\u200a64\u200a In July and August, when the peanut crops would come in, unsold and surplus peanuts would be prepared in a boiling pot, and extended families and neighbors would gather to share conversation and food.  Like a fish fry, peanut boils have been organizing principles for social gatherings. Like okra, fried green tomatoes, black-eyed peas, collard greens and pork barbecue, boiled peanuts are symbols of Southern culture and cuisine.\nThe first recipe for boiled peanuts was published by Almeda Lambert in 1899.:\u200a64\u200a  Boiled peanuts became a mainstream commodity in the lower South in the early 20th century.:\u200a64\u200a  A 1925 account from Orangeburg, South Carolina (where author Andrew F. Smith believes the sale of boiled peanuts may have begun), mentions boys hawking the food as a snack for five cents per bag.:\u200a64\u200a  The snack was also canned for consumption out of season.:\u200a64\n\nPreparation\nRaw peanuts and green peanuts are generally used for boiled peanuts. A green peanut is a farm-fresh harvested peanut that has not been dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors and farmers markets during the growing season. \"Raw\" peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled.Raw peanuts in the shell are put in a large pot of very heavily salted water and boiled. This can be done inside on a stove, or outside on a propane burner or fire pit for a larger volume. Depending on the locality, some cooks use rock salt or standard table salt, or both. The boil can go on from four to seven hours or more, depending on quantity and the age of the peanut (green peanuts cook faster and tend to be better tasting), and the boilings will most often be of several gallons of water. Flavorings such as ham hocks, hot sauce, Cajun seasonings or beer can be added to the boil. An alternative method for dried raw mature peanuts is to rehydrate them by soaking overnight in water, after which they can be cooked in the conventional manner.\nThe resulting snack is a very soft peanut in the shell, invariably quite salty. The softened peanuts are easy to open. Often small, immature peanuts (called \"pops\") are included; these have even softer shells and can be eaten in their entirety. They tend to absorb more salt than the larger ones. Some aficionados of the dish prefer them cooked for a shorter period of time so that the nut is not as soft.\nBoiled peanuts can become slimy or moldy quite quickly without refrigeration. Boiled peanuts can be frozen, then later reheated in a microwave or boiling water for out-of-season consumption. Properly frozen, the flavor is well maintained for even several years.\nBoiled peanuts can also be canned and are available commercially.\n\nCultural importance\nOn May 1, 2006, Governor Mark Sanford signed a bill, H.4585, making boiled peanuts the official snack food of South Carolina.\n\nAfrica\nIn Ghana and Nigeria, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food. They are also popular in the KwaZulu Natal region of South Africa, especially in Durban.\nHistorically, the Bambara groundnut was eaten boiled much like a boiled peanut in much of Africa.:\u200a8\u200a  Following the introduction of peanuts to Africa in the 16th century, they largely displaced the Bambara groundnut in cuisine.:\u200a9\n\nAsia\nIn China, peanuts are generally boiled with a little salt, sometimes with star anise.Boiled peanuts in Taiwan are called t\u01d4d\u00f2u (\u571f\u8c46), although this also refers to peanuts boiled without the hulls such as those in peanut soup (t\u01d4d\u00f2u tang \u571f\u8c46\u6e6f).  Boiled peanuts were traditionally sold in Taiwan by itinerant hawkers (rather than in fixed markets) or prepared in homes by boiling the peanuts in woks.  With itinerant hawkers increasingly rare in the country, boiled peanuts in the shell are now seldom consumed.\nIn Vietnam, boiled peanuts are called \u0111\u1eadu ph\u1ecdng lu\u1ed9c in the southern part of the country and l\u1ea1c lu\u1ed9c in the northern part of Vietnam. They are often appreciated by eating them at informal gatherings of friends and family while drinking beer poured over ice.\nIn India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.\n\nCentral and South America\nBoiled peanuts have been eaten for centuries in South America.:\u200a64\u200a  In Salvador, Bahia, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.Edward Long, in his 1774 History of Jamaica, notes the consumption of boiled peanuts on the island.:\u200a13\u200a  This practice was likely brought by the enslaved black people from Africa, where Long himself believed peanuts originated.:\u200a64,\u200a13\n\nPotential health benefits\nThe process of boiling peanuts draws antioxidants from their shells.  The boiled peanuts have four times the antioxidants of raw or roasted peanuts. Boiled peanuts have also been studied as a potential way to treat people with peanut allergies since boiling peanuts denatures proteins that trigger allergic reactions.  In one study, boiled peanuts were given in increasing amounts to four patients over time.  Some but not all patients were able to start eating raw peanuts.\n\nSee also\nList of peanut dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAbout the US Peanut Industry\nCommercial green peanut production (for boiled peanuts)\nGrowing peanuts in the garden (for boiled peanuts)\nSeriously Asian: Chinese Boiled Peanuts with photos of Chinese boiled peanuts\n\u6f8e\u6e56\u7f8e\u98df Penghu Cuisine photos of Taiwanese boiled peanuts (in Chinese)", "pages": ["Bambara groundnut", "Barbecue", "Bean", "Black-eyed peas", "Boiling in cooking", "Cajun cuisine", "China", "Collard greens", "Convenience store", "Doi (identifier)", "Edward Long (colonial administrator)", "Fish fry", "Florida", "Georgia (U.S. state)", "Ghana", "Goober Peas", "Halite", "Ham hock", "Hawker (trade)", "Helen, Georgia", "History of Jamaica (book)", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "India", "Indonesia", "Legume", "List of peanut dishes", "Mark Sanford", "Mississippi", "Nigeria", "North Carolina", "Nut (fruit)", "Ohio", "Okra", "Old Bay", "Orangeburg, South Carolina", "Pea", "Peanut", "Peanut butter", "Peanut soup", "Philippines", "Pork", "Salvador, Bahia", "South Carolina", "Southern US", "Southern United States", "Street food", "Taiwan", "Thailand", "Valencia peanut", "Vietnam", "Vigna subterranea", "Virginia peanut", "Wayback Machine", "West Africa", "Wok", "Zatarain's", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from June 2009"]}, "Turkish cuisine": {"body": "Almadroc is a garlic-cheese sauce from medieval Catalan cuisine from the Llibre de Sent Sov\u00ed.

African dish consisting of spiced minced meat baked with an egg-based topping.\n\nOrigin of name and recipe\nBobotie appears to be a variant of patinam ex lacte, a dish documented by the ancient Roman writer Apicius consisting of layers of cooked meat, pine nuts, and seasoned with pepper, celery seeds and asafoetida. These were cooked until the flavours had blended, when a top layer of egg and milk was added. When the latter had set, the dish was ready to be served. C. Louis Leipoldt, a South African writer and gourmet, wrote that the recipe was known in Europe in the seventeenth century.The origin of the word bobotie is contentious. The Afrikaans etymological dictionary claims that the probable origin is the Malayan word boemboe, meaning curry spices. Others think it to have originated from bobotok, an Indonesian dish which consisted of totally different ingredients. The first recipe for bobotie appeared in a Dutch cookbook in 1609. Afterwards, it was taken to South Africa and adopted by the Cape Malay community. It is also made with curry powder, leaving it with a slight \"tang\". It is often served with sambal. The dish has been known in the Cape of Good Hope since the 17th century, when it was made with a mixture of mutton and pork.\n\nPreparation\nToday, bobotie is much more likely to be made with beef or lamb, although pork can also be used. Early recipes incorporated ginger, marjoram and lemon rind; the introduction of curry powder has simplified the recipe but the basic concept remains the same. Some recipes also call for chopped onions and almonds to be added to the mixture. Traditionally, bobotie incorporates dried fruit like raisins or sultanas. It is often garnished with bay leaves, walnuts, chutney and bananas. Although not particularly spicy, the dish incorporates a variety of flavours that can add complexity. For example, the dried fruit (usually apricots and raisins or sultanas) contrasts the curry flavouring. The texture of the dish is also complex, the baked egg mixture topping complementing the milk-soaked bread which adds moisture to the dish. Bobotie is usually served with \"yellow rice\", which is rice cooked with turmeric.\n\nLeipoldt's recipe\nLeipoldt's recipe book published in 1933 calls for finely minced meat, breadcrumbs, milk, onions and butter and a curry sauce made with spices, sugar, lemon juice, chilli pepper and vinegar. This is baked with a topping of egg and milk.\n\nTulleken's recipe\nA 1923 recipe by Mrs S. van H. Tulleken uses mutton, almonds, bitter almond essence, onions, butter, bread, curry powder, lemon juice, eggs and sugar, baked with a custard topping of eggs and milk.\n\nBobotie elsewhere in Africa\nBobotie recipes were transported by South African settlers to other parts of Africa. Today, recipes for it can be found that originated in Afrikaner-descended settler communities in Botswana, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. There is a variation that was popular among the 7,000 Boer settlers who settled in the Chubut River Valley in Argentina in the early 20th century, in which the bobotie mixture is packed inside a large pumpkin, which is then baked until tender.\n\nIn culture\n2008 Augusta National Champions Dinner\nBobotie was selected by 2008 Masters golf champion and South African native Trevor Immelman as the featured menu item for Augusta National's annual \"Champions Dinner\"  in April 2009. Each year, the reigning champion at The Masters golf tournament, played every year in Augusta, Georgia, hosts the gathering and tends to create a menu featuring specialties from his home region.\n\n2014 Epcot International Food and Wine Festival\nSouth African bobotie was one of the featured items on the menu; it is also served with turkey and mushrooms. It is listed as gluten-free. It is also on the everyday menu at the buffet restaurant Boma at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge.\n\nSee also\nCook and Enjoy It, a cookbook by S.J.A. de Villiers\nList of African dishes\nList of meat dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBobotie recipe from Laurens van der Post\nBobotie recipe from Boma at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge", "pages": ["2008 Masters Tournament", "African cuisine", "Afrikaaners", "Algerian cuisine", "Almond", "Amarula", "Amasi", "Angolan cuisine", "Apicius", "Apricot", "Arab cuisine", "Argentina", "Asafoetida", "Augusta, Georgia", "Augusta National Golf Club", "Banana", "Bay leaves", "Benin cuisine", "Berber cuisine", "Biltong", "Bobote", "Bobotok", "Boeber", "Boer", "Boerewors", "Bokkoms", "Botswana", "Botswana cuisine", "Bumbu (seasoning)", "Bunny chow", "Burkinab\u00e9 cuisine", "Burundian cuisine", "C.

It was named after the place of its invention, the Divan Parisien Restaurant at Chatham Hotel in New York City where it was served as the signature dish in the early twentieth century. Its creator was a chef named Lagasi. In French, the word divan refers to a meeting place or great hall.\n\nHistory\nThere are many historic recipes for Chicken Divan found in cookbooks dating to the late 1950s and early 1960s, but their authenticity is uncertain since the original recipe was kept a secret. An approximation based on hints from the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel of the Divan Parisien is made with poached chicken breasts, broccoli and a cheesy b\u00e9chamel, or Mornay sauce, enriched with egg yolks.\n\nTypes of divan\nThe dish is now commonly prepared with regular Parmesan cheese and remains one of the most classic American casserole dishes today. A \"quick\" version can be made with pre-cooked chicken breasts, prepared mayonnaise and canned soup. Some  versions are topped with potato chips, in a manner similar to that of funeral potatoes.\nHart's Turkey Farm in New Hampshire serves a version using turkey instead of chicken.\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nChicken and broccoli\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Afritada", "Airline chicken", "Andong jjimdak", "Arroz caldo", "Arroz con pollo", "Ayam bakar", "Ayam bumbu rujak", "Ayam goreng", "Ayam goreng kalasan", "Ayam kecap", "Ayam kodok", "Ayam masak merah", "Ayam pansuh", "Ayam pop", "Ayam rica-rica", "Ayam taliwang", "BK Chicken Fries", "Ballotine", "Barbecue chicken", "Barberton chicken", "Bean sprouts chicken", "Beer can chicken", "Beggar's Chicken", "Betutu", "Binakol", "Bon bon chicken", "Bourbon chicken", "Bringhe", "Brown stew chicken", "Bubur ayam", "Buffalo wing", "Buldak", "Butter chicken", "B\u00e9chamel", "Cafreal", "Caldo X\u00f3chitl", "Caldo tlalpe\u00f1o", "Cashew chicken", "Casserole", "Chargha", "Chicken 65", "Chicken Chettinad", "Chicken Fran\u00e7aise", "Chicken Kiev", "Chicken Lahori", "Chicken Marengo", "Chicken Maryland", "Chicken Picasso", "Chicken Sukka", "Chicken Vesuvio", "Chicken and broccoli", "Chicken and duck blood soup", "Chicken and dumplings", "Chicken and mushroom pie", "Chicken and rice", "Chicken and waffles", "Chicken as food", "Chicken balls", "Chicken bog", "Chicken curry", "Chicken feet", "Chicken fingers", "Chicken inasal", "Chicken karahi", "Chicken katsu", "Chicken lollipop", "Chicken macaroni salad", "Chicken marsala", "Chicken mull", "Chicken nugget", "Chicken paprikash", "Chicken parmigiana", "Chicken riggies", "Chicken salad", "Chicken sandwich", "Chicken soup", "Chicken tabaka", "Chicken tatsuta", "Chicken tikka", "Chicken tikka masala", "Chicken \u00e0 la King", "Chikuzenni", "Chilli chicken", "Chimaek", "Chinese chicken salad", "Circassian chicken", "Claypot chicken rice", "Cock-a-leekie soup", "Coq au vin", "Cordon bleu (dish)", "Coronation chicken", "Country Captain", "Coxinha", "Crispy fried chicken", "C\u01a1m g\u00e0 rau th\u01a1m", "Dak-bokkeum-tang", "Dak-galbi", "Dakjuk", "Dapanji", "Divan", "Dong'an chicken", "Dragon tiger phoenix", "Drunken chicken", "Engagement chicken", "Escabeche oriental", "Flying Jacob", "Fried chicken", "Fujian red wine chicken", "Funeral potatoes", "Galinha \u00e0 africana", "Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa", "Galinhada", "Gallo en chicha", "General Tso's chicken", "Ginataang manok", "Gribenes", "Gulai ayam", "Hainanese chicken rice", "Hart's Turkey Farm", "Hawaiian haystack", "Helzel", "Hot chicken", "Huli-huli chicken", "ISBN (identifier)", "Inubaran", "Jerk (cooking)", "Jerusalem mixed grill", "Jubilee chicken", "Jujeh kabab", "KFC Original Recipe", "Kai yang", "Karaage", "Kedjenou", "King Ranch chicken", "Korean fried chicken", "Kori rotti", "Kung Pao chicken", "Kurnik (pirog)", "Kwetiau ayam", "Laziji", "Lechon manok", "Lemon chicken", "Lemon pepper wings", "Linagpang na Manok", "List of casserole dishes", "List of chicken dishes", "List of fried chicken dishes", "List of regional dishes of the United States", "Lontong cap go meh", "Mie ayam", "Moambe chicken", "Moo goo gai pan", "Moravian chicken pie", "Mornay sauce", "Murgh musallam", "Musakhan", "Nasi liwet", "Nasi tim", "Olivier salad", "Opor ayam", "Orange chicken", "Ostropel", "Padak", "Pastilla", "Philippine adobo", "Piaparan", "Piccata", "Pinchitos", "Pinikpikan", "Pininyahang manok", "Piyanggang manok", "Plecing ayam", "Pollo a la Brasa", "Potato chip", "Poule au riz", "Poulet au fromage", "Pozharsky cutlet", "Roast chicken", "Rollatini", "Rotisserie chicken", "Sajji", "Saltimbocca", "Samgye-tang", "Sanbeiji", "Satay", "Scaloppine", "Sesame chicken", "Shawarma", "Shish taouk", "Sinampalukan", "Sopas", "Sorol (food)", "Soto ayam", "Soy sauce chicken", "Spice bag", "Sweet and sour", "Swiss wing", "Taiwanese fried chicken", "Talunan", "Tandoori chicken", "Tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc", "Thalassery cuisine", "Tinola", "Tongdak", "Tsukune", "Turducken", "Waterzooi", "White cut chicken", "Yakitori", "Yangnyeom chicken", "Yassa (food)", "Template:Chicken dishes", "Template talk:Chicken dishes"]}, "Help:IPA/Swedish": {"body": "Flying Jacob (Swedish: flygande Jacob/Jakob pronounced [fly\u02d0\u02c8gand\u025b j\u0251\u02d0\u02c8k\u0254p]) is a Swedish casserole composed of chicken, cream, chilli sauce, bananas, roasted peanuts and bacon.

The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.\nThe first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, the Scottish were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat. There is an English cookbook from 1736 which mentions fried chicken, the \u201cDictionarium Domesticum\u201d, by Nathan Bailey. Meanwhile, many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil).\n\nHistory\nThe American English expression \"fried chicken\" was first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s. The origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has been traced to precedents in Scottish and West African cuisine. Scottish fried chicken was cooked in fat, and West African fried chicken added different seasonings, and was battered and cooked in palm oil. Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in the American South by enslaved Africans.Fried chicken provided some means of an independent economy for enslaved and segregated African-American women, who became noted sellers of poultry (live or cooked) as early as the 1730s. Because of the expensive nature of the ingredients, it was, despite popular belief, a rare dish in the African-American community reserved (as in Africa) for special occasions.\nWhen it was introduced to the American South, fried chicken became a common staple. Later, as the slave trade led to Africans being brought to work on southern plantations, the enslaved people who became cooks incorporated seasonings and spices that were absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, enriching the flavor. Since most enslaved people were unable to raise expensive meats, but were generally allowed to keep chickens, frying chicken on special occasions continued in the African-American communities of the South, especially in the periods of segregation that closed off most restaurants to the black population.American-style fried chicken gradually passed into everyday use as a general Southern dish, especially after the abolition of slavery, and its popularity spread. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace and industry growth reduced its cost, it gained further favor across the South. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for \"Sunday dinner\". Holidays such as Independence Day and other gatherings often feature this dish. During the 20th century, chain restaurants focused on fried chicken began among the boom in the fast food industry. Brands such as Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Popeyes expanded in the United States and across the world.\nBefore the industrialization of chicken production and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried.\n\nDescription\nFried chicken has been described as being \"crunchy\" and \"juicy\", as well as \"crispy\". The dish has also been called \"spicy\" and \"salty\". Occasionally, fried chicken is also topped with chili like paprika, or hot sauce to give it a spicy taste. This is especially common in fast food restaurant chains such as KFC. The dish is traditionally served with mashed potatoes, gravy, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, corn or biscuits.The dish is renowned for being greasy, especially when coming from fast food outlets. It has even been reported that some of those who enjoy eating the food limit themselves to eating it only a certain number of times a year, to keep their fat intake reasonably low. Out of the various parts of the animal used in fried chicken, the wings generally tend to contain the most fat, with almost 40 grams (1.4 oz) of fat for every 100 grams (3.5 oz). However, the average whole fried chicken contains only around 12% fat, or 12 grams (0.42 oz) per every 100 grams (3.5 oz). 100 grams (3.5 oz) of fried chicken generally contains around 240 calories of energy.\n\nPreparation\nGenerally, chickens are not fried whole. Instead, the chicken is divided into its constituent pieces. The white meat sections are the breast and the wings from the front of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thighs and legs or \"drumsticks\" from the rear of the chicken. The breast is typically split into two pieces, and the back is usually discarded. Chicken fingers, which are boneless pieces of chicken breast cut into long strips, are also commonly used.To prepare the chicken pieces for frying, they are typically coated in a flour-based batter that may contain eggs or milk, or they may be dredged in flour or breadcrumbs. Seasonings such as salt, black pepper, chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, or onion powder can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or dipping in buttermilk, the acidity of which acts as a meat tenderizer. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust.\nTraditionally, lard is used to fry the chicken, but corn oil, peanut oil, canola oil, soybean oil, or other vegetable oils are also frequently used. The flavor of olive oil is generally considered too strong to be used for traditional fried chicken, and its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for use. There are three main techniques for frying chickens: pan frying, deep frying and broasting.Pan frying (or shallow frying) requires a frying pan of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally, the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done, the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan becomes the fonds required to make gravy.Deep frying requires a deep fryer or other devices in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is placing food fully in oil and then cooking it at a very high temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.A pressure cooker can be used to accelerate the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, such that lowering the cooking temperature is needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a pressure cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on the pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure. The original recipe used by the KFC franchise used this method, which was marketed as \"broasting\" by the Broaster Company.\nThe derivative phrases \"country-fried\" and \"chicken-fried\" often refer to other foods prepared in the manner of fried chicken. Usually, this means a boneless, tenderized piece of meat that has been floured or battered and cooked in any of the methods described. Chicken-fried steak is a common dish of that variety. Such dishes are often served with gravy.\n\nVariants\nBarberton chicken, also known as \"Serbian fried chicken\", is a version created by Serbian immigrants in Barberton, Ohio, that has been popularized throughout that state.\nChicken and waffles is a combination platter of foods traditionally served at breakfast and dinner in one meal, common to soul food restaurants in the American South and beyond.\nChicken Maryland is a form of pan-fried chicken, often marinated in buttermilk, served with cream gravy and native to the state of Maryland. The recipe spread beyond the United States to the haute cuisine of Auguste Escoffier and, after heavy modification, found a place in the cuisines of Britain and Australia. The dish is made when a pan of chicken pieces and fat, as for pan-frying, is placed in the oven to cook, for a majority of the overall cooking time, basically \"fried in the oven\".\nHot chicken, common in the Nashville, Tennessee area, is a pan-fried variant coated with lard and cayenne pepper paste.\nPopcorn chicken, also known as \"chicken bites\" or other similar terms, are small morsels of boneless chicken, battered and fried, resulting in small pieces that resemble popcorn.\n\nHealth effects\nA 2019 prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women found that consumption of at least one serving of fried chicken per week compared to no consumption is associated with a 13% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality, as well as with a 12% increase in the risk of cardiovascular mortality.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMcMillan, Bo (July 5, 2014). \"Consumers flock to new takes on fried chicken\".

GRAT-a doh-fi-NWAH) is a French gratin of sliced raw potatoes baked in cream, from the Dauphin\u00e9 region in south-eastern France.

It is a quite different dish from pommes dauphine.\n\nHistory\nThe first mention of the dish is from 12 July 1788. It was served with ortolans at a dinner given by Charles-Henri, Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre and Lieutenant-general of the Dauphin\u00e9, for the municipal officials of the town of Gap, now in the d\u00e9partement of Hautes-Alpes.:\u200a242\n\nPreparation\nGratin dauphinois is made with thinly sliced raw potatoes and cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic; cheese is sometimes added. The potatoes are peeled and sliced to the thickness of a coin, usually with a mandoline; they are layered in a shallow earthenware or glass baking dish and cooked in a slow oven; the heat is raised for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.:\u200a251\u200a:\u200a337\u200aBy tradition, the gratin dauphinois does not include cheese,:\u200a350\u200a:\u200a151\u200a which would make it more similar to a gratin savoyard (which does not include cream).:\u200a263\u200a Recipes given by many chefs \u2013 including Auguste Escoffier, Austin de Croze and Constance Spry \u2013 call for cheese and eggs;:\u200a251\u200a:\u200a725\u200a:\u200a207\u200a others such as Robert Carrier specify cheese but no egg.:\u200a211\u200aThe gratin dauphinois is distinguished from ordinary gratin potatoes by the use of raw rather than boiled potatoes.:\u200a249\u200a It is a quite different dish from pommes dauphine.:\u200a251\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Ajiaco", "Aligot", "Aloo chaat", "Aloo gobi", "Aloo gosht", "Aloo pie", "Aloo tikki", "Auguste Escoffier", "Austin de Croze", "Baeckeoffe", "Baked potato", "Bangers and mash", "Batata harra", "Batata vada", "Bonda (snack)", "Boxty", "Brandade", "Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky", "Br\u00e6ndende k\u00e6rlighed", "Bubble and squeak", "Burrito", "Carapulcra", "Carne asada fries", "Cepelinai", "Champ (food)", "Cheese fries", "Chip butty", "Chorrillana", "Chu\u00f1o", "Clapshot", "Coddle", "Colcannon", "Constance Spry", "Counts of Clermont-Tonnerre", "Cream", "Crisp sandwich", "Croquette", "Curly fries", "Dauphin\u00e9", "Duchess potatoes", "D\u00e9partement", "Fondant potatoes", "French fries", "French tacos", "Fried potatoes", "Fritter", "Funeral potatoes", "Gamja-jeon", "Gamja-ongsimi", "Gamja-tang", "Gap, Hautes-Alpes", "German fries", "Gnocchi", "Gratin", "Halal snack pack", "Hash browns", "Hasselback potatoes", "Hautes-Alpes", "Himmel und Erde", "Home fries", "Homity pie", "Hutspot", "ISBN (identifier)", "Imelletty perunalaatikko", "Jansson's temptation", "Kapsalon", "Kartoffelk\u00e4se", "Knish", "Kouign patatez", "Kripik", "Kroppkaka", "Kugelis", "Lancashire hotpot", "Latke", "Lefse", "Lieutenant-General (France)", "List of casserole dishes", "List of potato dishes", "Llapingacho", "Lobscouse", "Lomo saltado", "Lyonnaise potatoes", "Maluns", "Mandoline", "Mashed potato", "Mince and tatties", "Mitraillette", "Munini-imo", "Nikujaga", "Ocopa", "Olivier salad", "Ortolan bunting", "Panackelty", "Papa a la Huanca\u00edna", "Papa rellena", "Papas arrugadas", "Papas chorreadas", "Papet Vaudois", "Patatas bravas", "Patatnik", "Perkedel", "Peter John Graham", "Pitepalt", "Pommes Anna", "Pommes boulang\u00e8re", "Pommes dauphine", "Pommes souffl\u00e9es", "Potato babka", "Potato bread", "Potato cake", "Potato chip", "Potato doughnut", "Potato kugel", "Potato pancake", "Potato salad", "Potato scone", "Potato skins", "Potato waffle", "Potato wedges", "Potatoes O'Brien", "Potatonik", "Poutine", "Poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e", "Pyttipanna", "P\u00e2t\u00e9 aux pommes de terre", "P\u00e9la (dish)", "Raclette", "Ragda pattice", "Rappie pie", "Raspeball", "Reibekuchen", "Rewena bread", "Robert Carrier (chef)", "Rumbledethumps", "R\u00f6sti", "Salchipapa", "Salt potatoes", "Samosa", "Sayur sop", "Selat solo", "Shepherd's pie", "Skomakarl\u00e5da", "Spanish omelette", "Spice bag", "Stamppot", "Stoemp", "Stovies", "Sza\u0142ot", "Szilv\u00e1sgomb\u00f3c", "Tartiflette", "Tater tots", "Tombet", "Tornado potato", "Trinxat", "Triple-cooked chips", "Truffade", "Vada (food)", "Vada pav", "Wrap roti", "Yapchik", "\u00c4lplermagronen", "Template:Potato dishes", "Template talk:Potato dishes", "Help:IPA/English", "Help:Pronunciation respelling key", "Category:EngvarB from May 2013", "Category:Use dmy dates from December 2022", "Category:Use list-defined references from May 2013"]}, "Help:CS1 errors": {"body": "Hoppel poppel is an egg casserole made with leftovers, a dish associated with frugal housewives.Found in German and Austrian cuisine, the casserole dish is also associated with the Midwestern United States. The basic recipe for the casserole is home fries (fried potatoes), scrambled eggs, and onion. Sometimes it is topped with melted cheese. Other ingredients like green pepper or mushrooms can be added to the basic combination, and a variety of meats can be used including bacon, ham and salami.\n\nDescription\nThe basic form of the dish was just potatoes, onions, meat and scrambled eggs, but more elaborate variations could be devised with green peppers, melted cheese and mushrooms. The meat could be ham, bacon, sausage, or even all-beef salami. Hoppel poppel was served at Jewish delicatessens (despite not strictly adhering to kosher dietary regulations) and these establishments made the dish with all-beef salami.\n\nPreparation\nWith bacon\nTo make Hoppel Popel the first step was to cook the meat in a skillet, then set the cooked meat aside and add the onions to cook in the drippings. The onions were removed from the pan once they took on a golden color, and butter was added to the remaining drippings, then the potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and when they were browned the meat and onions were returned to the pan and the eggs added until the eggs set.\n\nWith beef salami\nAnother way of making hoppel poppel without pork begins by parboiling the potatoes, then slicing them and frying in vegetable oil. Butter is added with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and beef salami. The eggs and whisked with milk and parsley and gently scrambled in the skillet. When the eggs have started to set the cheese topping can be added, and the dish cooked covered for a few more minutes until the cheese has melted and the eggs are fully cooked.\n\nWith boiled beef\nHoppel poppel could also be made with boiled beef to use up leftovers. This version of the dish begins by cooking the boiled beef and onion in butter, with bacon. When the bacon is cooked whisked eggs are added and cooked like an omelette.\n\nWith ham\nFor a hoppel poppel with ham, cubed potatoes and onions were pan-fried in butter until the potatoes were browned, then ham was added to the skillet. Eggs were whisked with cognac, salt and pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and poured into the skillet, cooked gently as an omelette, with fresh parsley. When the omelette is set it was topped with grated cheese and finished in the broiler.\n\nSee also\nBauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck\nStemmelkort\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["American cuisine", "Austrian cuisine", "Bauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck", "Breakfast", "Casserole", "Cognac", "Cuisine of the Midwest", "German cuisine", "Home fries", "Hoppel poppel (beverage)", "ISBN (identifier)", "Omelette", "Parboiling", "Stemmelkort", "Worcestershire sauce", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Template:Breakfast-stub", "Template:Cite book", "Template:US-cuisine-stub", "Template talk:Breakfast-stub", "Template talk:US-cuisine-stub", "Help:CS1 errors"]}, "Category:Orphaned articles from January 2016": {"body": "Hot Mash (English: slang), is a large, deep dish of food cooked within a casserole dish. Hot Mash is a particular variety of casserole whose genesis is generally considered to have originated in the Midwest Continental United States. Although the exact date and creator cannot be pinpointed, articles began mentioning hot mash during the late 1930s and Hot Mash's popularity took off in the 1950s and 1960s after Elvis mentioned it was one of his favorite dishes that his \"momma made [him] when he came home.\"Hot Mash generally consists of a butter base with a chocolate product melted in, pieces of meat (such as beef, chicken, lamb, venison, or even pieces of lake trout), various types of starchy binders like pasta, potatoes, or hash browns, and often a crunchy cheese topping.\n\nEtymology\nHistorians and journalists of the era often cite two possible sources for Hot Mash's unique name. A characteristic Hot Mash generally is very thick when prepared correctly using a condensed soup as the base with the butter and chocolate. This thickness often became the go-to signature of a good Hot Mash, so much so, that local eateries and journalists primarily judge a good Hot Mash based upon the viscosity of the finished product. In a particularly famous exchange, one Hot Mash cook in the Des Moines Register once claimed that his Hot Mash was \"so thick it could fix a pothole better than hot slurry.\"The other predominate theory regarding the etymology of the name deals with the composition of the dish. In preparing Hot Mash, many of the ingredients, especially the starches, will need to be mashed in order to facilitate the dining experience.\n\nInitial reactions\nGiven the unusual mix of sweet and salty flavors, those unfamiliar with Hot Mash tend to exhibit close-minded behaviors and are characterized by rejecting offers of the home-cooked staple.  Since its creation, at least one individual trying Hot Mash has said \"Wow - this is not sweet and salty.  This is sweet, salty, and great!\"  An unaccredited scientific research group is quoted as saying \"the combination of saltiness and sweetness create tasteful synergy.\"\n\nProtein implementation\nIn the late 20th century, those residing within the Tri-State region of the Midwest began substituting the initial cocoa powder ingredient with whey protein.  In time since, athletes have become stronger, faster, and more competitive overall.  It is believed by several that this new Hot Mash recipe is the reason for such.    \n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Casserole", "Condensed soup", "Elvis Presley", "Etymology", "Journalist", "Unaccredited", "Viscosity", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Wikipedia:Citing sources", "Wikipedia:Orphan", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Help:Link", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles lacking sources from January 2016", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from January 2016", "Category:Orphaned articles from January 2016"]}, "Category:CS1 maint: archived copy as title": {"body": "Fried pies, also known as Fry pies, are mainly dessert pies that are similar to turnovers, except that they are smaller and fried.

McDonald's apple pies were introduced on the menu in 1968, but in 1992 they were phased out in favor of a baked pie (claimed to be healthier) in the United States. There are some McDonald's restaurants throughout the US and world which still offer the fried pies, including all McDonald's restaurants in the Republic of Ireland, United Kingdom and Japan. Flavors include cherry and apple (US mainland), taro, and haupia, (Hawaii), and green bean or red bean (China). The Burger King chain also offers fried pies on its menu, in apple and \"wild berry\" flavors. Whataburger and Popeyes also offer fried pies.Hubig's, New Orleans' famous local fried pie maker and the last one of its kind, burned on July 27, 2012, but expects to rebuild. It was the last one from a southeastern chain that originated in Ft. Worth, Texas, that did not survive the Great Depression. The owners originally stated that they planned to rebuild the factory as soon as possible. As of 2022, the factory is now finished.\n\nSee also\nDoughnut\nEmpanada\nFritter\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFried pie recipe from the cooking studio at the John C.

Butter and eggs may be mixed into the mash, which may also be flavoured with sugar, salt, white pepper and grated nutmeg. The mash is put in a casserole dish and baked in the oven. The carrots need not necessarily be boiled before baking: they can be grated and mixed raw with the other ingredients.

(North American), kebap, or kabab is roasted meat that originates from the Middle East and has been popularised by Iranian, Arabic and Turkish cuisine. Many variants of the category are popular around the world, including the skewered shish kebab and the doner kebab with bread.\nKebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).\n\nHistory\nIn Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh (Arabic: \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u062e), a compendium of much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisine, there are descriptions of kab\u0101b as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire.However, while the word kebab or shish kebab may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer, kebab is mainly associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in the medieval kitchens of Persia and Anatolia. Though the word has ancient origins, it was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to this range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on skewers, but also as stews, meatballs, and other forms. This cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim influence. According to Ibn Battuta, a Maghrebi traveller, kebab was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206\u20131526 CE), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan. Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.The word kebab likely came to English in the late 17th century from the Persian kab\u0101b, partly through Hindustani, and Turkish. According to linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan, the Turkish word kebap is also derived from the Persian word kab\u0101b, meaning roasted meat. It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in Kyssa-i Yusuf (lit.\u2009'the story of Joseph'), though still in the Persian form. Ni\u015fanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of 'frying, burning' with kab\u0101bu in the old Akkadian language, and kbab\u0101 \u05db\u05d1\u05d1\u05d0 in Aramaic. In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian kabab, which probably derived from the Aramaic.The American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of 'burn', 'char', or 'roast', from the Aramaic and Akkadian. The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not be kabbaba (burned). These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: *kab-, to burn or roast.\n\nVarieties by region\nIn most English-speaking countries, a kebab may be the classic shish kebab or souvlaki \u2013 small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer \u2013 or made with minced (ground) meat, as in doner kebab. By contrast, in Indian English, Bangladeshi English, Pakistani English and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a kebab is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese chuan.\n\nEast Asia\nChina\nChuan (Chinese: \u4e32; pinyin: chu\u00e0n), often referred to as \"chuan\" in Mandarin throughout the north, or kawap (\u0643\u0627\u06cb\u0627\u067e) in Uyghur, is a variation of kebab originating from the Uyghur people in the western province of Xinjiang and a popular dish in Chinese Islamic cuisine. The dish has since spread across the rest of the country and become a popular street food.\nAlthough the most traditional form of chuan uses lamb or mutton, other types of meat, such as chicken, beef, pork, and seafood, may be used as well. Small pieces of meat are skewered and either roasted or deep-fried. Common spices and condiments include cumin called \"ziran\", pepper, sesame, and sesame oil.\n\nEurope\nGreece\nWhile the history of street foods in Greece goes back to ancient times, the iconic Greek gyros and souvlaki as it is known today arose only following the Second World War. Introduced to Athens in the 1950s by Greek refugees from Turkey and the Middle East, gyros was originally known simply as d\u00f6ner kebab. It is typically served as a sandwich rolled in pita bread, or on a plate, with french fries and various salads and sauces such as tzatziki. Later in the 1960s, vendors also began selling dishes in the same style made with souvlaki, which resembles Turkish shish kebab, but is usually made with pork.Around the same time, the Greek word gyros replaced d\u00f6ner kebab, and the Greek style of the dish spread to become popular, particularly in North America, and various other parts of the world.In contrast to other areas of Greece, in Athens, both types of sandwich may be called souvlaki, with the skewered meat being called kalamaki.\nAlthough gyros is unquestionably of Middle Eastern origin, the issue of whether modern-day souvlaki came to Greece via Turkish cuisine, and should be considered a Greek styling of shish kebab, or is a contemporary revival of Greek tradition dating as far back as 17th century BC Minoan civilization, is a topic of sometimes heated debate, at least between Greeks and Turks. While English speakers may refer to souvlaki skewers as kebabs, they are not properly called that in Greece.\n\nWest Asia and North Africa\nSouth Caucasus\nBoth Armenian and Azerbaijani cuisine feature oblong kofta-style mincemeats kebabs known as lula or lyulya kebab, while \nArmenian cuisine refers to shish-style kebabs as khorovats, and doner kebab as Karsi khorovats after the city of Kars which became known for the dish during the time of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIran\nThere are several distinct Persian varieties of kebab (Persian: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628). Kebab may be served with either steamed, saffroned basmati or Persian rice and called chelow kabab (\u0686\u0644\u0648\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628), which is considered the national dish of Iran. It may also be served with the various types of bread that are the most commonly eaten in Iran, such as lavash.\nIt is served with the basic Iranian meal accompaniments, in addition to grilled tomatoes on the side of the rice and butter on top of the rice. It is an old northern tradition (probably originating in Tehran) that a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the rice as well, though this is strictly optional, and most restaurants will not serve the rice this way unless it is specifically requested. \"Somagh\", powdered sumac, is also made available and its use varies based on tastes to a small dash on the rice or a heavy sprinkling on both rice and meat, particularly when used with red (beef/veal/lamb) meat.\nAt Persian restaurants, the combination of one kabab barg and one kabab koobideh is typically called Soltani, meaning \"sultan's feast\". The combination of one kabab barg, one jujeh kabab and kabab koobideh is typically called Sah abbasi, meaning \"shah's meal\". The traditional beverage of choice to accompany kebab is doogh, a sour yogurt drink with mint and salt.\nIn the old bazaar tradition, the rice (which is covered with a tin lid) and accompaniments are served first, immediately followed by the kebabs, which are brought to the table by the waiter, who holds several skewers in his left hand, and a piece of flat bread (typically nan-e lavash) in his right. A skewer is placed directly on the rice and while holding the kebab down on the rice with the bread, the skewer is quickly pulled out. With the two most common kebabs, barg and koobideh, two skewers are always served. In general, bazaar kebab restaurants only serve these two varieties, though there are exceptions.\nIn Iranian Azerbaijan, \"Binab (also Bonab) Kebabi\" is very famous in Azerbaijani cuisine for its large size. It is named after the city of Binab in East Azerbaijan province. This kebab and other types (e.g., Shishlik, kubide, Berge, Gelin, etc.) can be served alone or with rice and fresh salad on the side. In this region Kebabs come usually with yogurt, hot bread, tomato, onion, parsley and paprika-salt, and tarragon.\n\nKabab koobideh (\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647) it k\u016bbide (\u06a9\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647) is an Iranian minced meat kabab which is made from ground lamb, beef, or chicken, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions.\nKabab Koobideh contains: ground meat, onion, salt, pepper, turmeric, and seasoning. These ingredients are mixed together until the mixture becomes smooth and sticky. One egg is added to help the mix stick together. The mixture is then pressed around a skewer. Koobideh Kabab is typically 18 to 20 centimeters (7\u20138 in) long.\nKab\u0101b-e barg (Persian: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u06af) is a Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef kebab dish. The main ingredients of Kabab Barg \u2013 a short form of this name \u2013 are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank or chicken breast, onions and olive oil.\nMarinade is prepared by the mixture of half a cup of olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4\u20135 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in refrigerator, and the container should be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5\u201310 minutes on each side. Kabab-e Barg\nJ\u016bje-kab\u0101b (\u062c\u0648\u062c\u0647\u200c\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) consists of pieces of chicken first marinated in minced onion and lemon juice with saffron then grilled over a fire. It is sometimes served with grilled tomato and pepper. Jujeh kabab is one of the most popular Persian dishes.\nKabab Bakhtiari is a combination of Jujeh kabab (chicken kabab) and Kabab barg (beef or lamb meat) on the same skewer. Its name comes from the Bakhtiari region of Iran.\nKabab Kenjeh, also known as Chenjeh (\u06a9\u0646\u062c\u0647\u200c\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628, \u0686\u0646\u062c\u0647) is a kabab traditionally made with chunks of marinated lamb meat. It is typically served with grilled tomatoes and rice or bread.Kabab torsh is an Iranian kabab from the northern provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, renowned for its sour, pomegranate based seasoning.Kabab Lari, Kabab Tabe (pan), Dande Kabab, Kabab Shandiz, Shishlik Kabab, Kabab Ghafghazi, Uzun kabab of Tabriz,  Doosh Kabab of Guilan, Chump (Jump) kabob of Sistan, Kabab Toori of Tabriz, Kabob Golpayegan, Kabab Tanoorcheh of Baluchestan, Kabab Soltani, Kabob Vaziri, Kabob Loghmeh, Taas kabab, Mahi kabab (fish kabab) and Kabab Jegar (sheep liver) are among other types of Kabab popular in Iran.\n\nIraq\nSeveral types of kebab are popular in Iraqi cuisine, although the word kebab in local use is reserved for skewers of spiced ground lamb, traditionally grilled on natural wood charcoal to give the kebab its special flavor. Skewers of grilled marinated meat chunks are called tikka.\n\nThe Levant and Egypt\nSeveral varieties of kebabs can be found in Levantine cuisine. Among the most common are shish taouk, which are grilled chicken skewers marinated in olive oil and spices, and lahem meshwi, charcoal-grilled skewers of prime lamb cubes lightly seasoned with herbs.Mizrahi Jews brought various types of grilled meat from their native Middle Eastern countries to Israel, where they have become an essential part of Israeli cuisine. Among the most popular are skewers of elongated spiced ground meat, called kabab (Hebrew: \u05e7\u05d1\u05d1), which have become a staple dish of meat restaurants and the main dish of the traditional holiday barbecues, alongside the shishlik. They are commonly made of beef, though lamb is also occasionally used, and are almost always served with the local pita bread.\nShawarma, although not considered a kebab in most countries of the Levant and Egypt, is another very popular type of grilled meat preparation that characterizes this region.\n\nTurkey\nAdana kebap (or k\u0131yma kebab\u0131) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled over charcoal. Named after the Turkish city of Adana, the kebab is generally \"hot\" or piquant. The traditional Adana kebab is made using lamb, with a high fatty content cooked over hot coals.  Only three ingredients are used in a proper Adana kebab, minced lamb, red capsicum (pepper) and salt.\nAli Pa\u015fa kebab\u0131, \"Ali Pasha kebab\" \u2013 cubed lamb with tomato, onion and parsley wrapped in phillo.\nAlinazik \u2013 Ground meat kebab saut\u00e9ed in a saucepan,  with garlic, yogurt and eggplants added.\nBeyti kebap \u2013 Ground lamb or beef, seasoned and grilled on a skewer, often served wrapped in lavash and topped with tomato sauce and yogurt, traced back to the famous kebab house Beyti in Istanbul and particularly popular in Turkey's larger cities.\nBostan kebab\u0131 \u2013 Lamb and aubergine casserole.\nBu\u011fu kebab\u0131 \u2013 Steam kebab, is a Turkish stew which is cooked in a pan or an earthenware casserole. The casserole's lid is sealed in order to cook the meat in its own juices. The dish is prepared with pearl onions, garlic, thyme  and other spices. In Tekirda\u011f, it is served with cumin; in \u0130zmir, it is served with mastic.\nCa\u011f kebap, 'spoke kebab' \u2013 Cubes of lamb roasted first on a ca\u011f (a horizontal rotating spit) and then on a skewer, a specialty of Erzurum region with recently rising popularity.\nCi\u011fer kebab\u0131, 'liver kebab' - usually eaten with sliced onions, salad and bread.\n\u00c7\u00f6kertme kebab\u0131 \u2013 Sirloin veal kebap stuffed with yogurt and potatoes.\n\u00c7\u00f6p \u015fi\u015f, \"small skewer kebab\" \u2013 a speciality of Sel\u00e7uk and Germencik near Ephesus, pounded boneless meat with tomatoes and garlic marinated with black pepper, thyme and oil on wooden skewers.\nD\u00f6ner kebap, literally \"rotating kebab\" in Turkish, is sliced lamb, beef, or chicken, slowly roasted on a vertical rotating spit. The Middle Eastern shawarma, Mexican tacos al pastor, and Greek gyros are all derived from the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab, which was invented in Bursa in the 19th century. The German-style d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich, sometimes called simply \"a kebab\" in English, was introduced by Turkish immigrants in Berlin in the 1970s, and has become one of the most popular take-away foods in Germany and much of Europe. It is commonly sold by Turks, and considered a Turkish-German specialty, in Germany.\nH\u00fcnk\u00e2ri kebab\u0131, 'Sultan's kebab' \u2013 Sliced lamb meat mixed with patl\u0131can be\u011fendi (aubergine pur\u00e9e), basil, thyme and bay leaf.\n\u0130skender kebap \u2013 d\u00f6ner kebab served with yogurt, tomato sauce and butter, originated in Bursa. This kebab was invented by \u0130skender Efendi in 1867. He was inspired from Ca\u011f kebab and turned it from horizontal to vertical.\n\u0130slim kebab\u0131, 'steamed kebab' \u2013 Another version of the aubergine kebab without its skin, marinated in sunflower oil.\nKa\u011f\u0131t kebab\u0131 \u2013 Lamb cooked in a paper wrapping.\nKuzu \u015fi\u015f \u2013 Shish prepared with marinated milk-fed lamb meat.\nManisa Kebab \u2013 This Manisa region version of the kebab is smaller and flat size shish meat on the sliced pide bread, flavored with butter, and stuffed with tomato, garlic and green pepper.\nPatl\u0131can kebab\u0131, 'aubergine kebab' \u2013 Special kebap meat marinated in spices and served with eggplant (aubergine), hot pide bread and a yogurt sauce.\nShish kebap \u2013 is a dish consisting of small cubes of meat or fish threaded on a skewer and grilled. \u015ei\u015f, pronounced [\u0283i\u0283], is a Turkish word meaning \"sword\" or \"skewer\". According to tradition, the dish was invented by medieval soldiers who used their swords to grill meat over open-field fires. In Turkey, shish kebab does not normally contain vegetables, though they may be cooked on a separate skewer. It can be prepared with lamb, beef, chicken, or fish, but pork is not used. The Pontian Greeks made a dish similar to shish kebabs, although theirs were cooked in a saucepan.\nTavuk \u015fi\u015f \u2013 Yogurt-marinated chicken grilled on a stick.\nTesti kebab\u0131, 'earthenware-jug kebab' \u2013 is a dish from Central Anatolia and the Mid-Western Black Sea region, consisting of a mixture of meat and vegetables cooked in a clay pot or jug over fire (testi means jug in Turkish). The pot is sealed with bread dough or foil and is broken when serving.\n\nSouth Asia\nSouth Asia has a rich kebab tradition with a great variety of different kebab dishes. Many modern kebabs in Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani cuisine trace their origins back to the time of the Mughals and the strong influence of Mughlai cuisine. Kebab dishes common to one or more of these countries include:\n\nTandoori kebab (Urdu: \u062a\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628)\nNaga doner kebab\nTikka kebab\nKathi Kebab (including Porota Kababs, kebab wraps)\nShami kebab (Urdu: \u0634\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) - A Shami kebab is a small patty of minced beef or chicken and ground chickpeas and spices.\nSeekh kebab (Urdu: \u0633\u064a\u062e \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) - A long skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasonings, it takes its name from the skewer.\nTunde ke kabab (Urdu: \u0679\u0646\u0688\u06d2 \u06a9\u06d2 \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628)\nBun kebab (Urdu: \u0628\u0646 \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) - A unique kebab sandwich with beef, lamb, fish or chicken.\nShatkora doner kebab\nChapli kebab (Urdu: \u0686\u067e\u0644\u06cc \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) - A spiced, tangy round kebab made of ground beef and cooked in animal fat. A speciality of Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\nBihari kebab (Urdu: \u0628\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) - Skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasoning.\nKalmi kebab (Urdu: \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628)\nSheesh kebab (Urdu: \u0634\u06cc\u0634 \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628)\nBurrah kebab - made from goat or lamb chops, liberally marinated with spices and charcoal grilled.\n\nAfghanistan\nAfghan kebab (Pashto/Dari: \u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0628) is most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant. In Afghan cuisine, kebab is served with naan, rarely rice, and customers have the option to sprinkle sumac or ghora, dried ground sour grapes, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor.\nOther popular kebabs include the lamb chop, ribs, beef, buffalo, and chicken, all of which are found in better restaurants.\nChapli kebab, a specialty of Eastern Afghanistan, is a patty made from beef mince. It is prepared flat and round, and served with naan. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste and less expensive.\n\nBangladesh\nIn Bangladesh they make variations of kebab (Bengali \u0995\u09be\u09ac\u09be\u09ac or \"Kabab\"). In the old Mughal province of Bengal Subah's capital of Dhaka, various Pakistani and Indian-influenced dishes started to be made. Amongst these were kebabs. In Bangladeshi cuisine, most kebabs are made using fish or beef.\n\nIndia\nModern-day kebabs in India mostly trace their origin to the influence of Mughlai cuisine. Some Indian kebabs have very specific geographic attributions, such as Kakori kebab, which is made of finely ground, soft mince and attributed to the city of Kakori in Uttar Pradesh, where legend has it that it was first prepared for old and toothless pilgrims.\n\nPakistan\nIn Pakistan kebabs trace back their origin during the time of the Mughals Mughlai cuisine, and their influence on the cuisine of modern-day Pakistan. There are all sorts of kebab varieties such as seekh, chapli, shammi and other forms of roasted and grilled meats. As Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country, pork is not used. Instead meats like beef, chicken, lamb, fish and sometimes buff are used in the making of kebabs.\n\nSoutheast Asia\nSatay is a kebab of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, served with a sauce. It is a dish of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, lamb, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu. Traditionally skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond are used, although bamboo skewers are often used instead. It is grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire with spicy seasonings. It may be served with various sauces, though most often a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.Satay was developed by Javanese street vendors as a unique adaptation of Indian kebab. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as tongseng and gulai kambing based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century. It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa\nSouth Africa\nSosatie (plural sosaties) is a traditional South African dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term derives from sate (\"skewered meat\") and saus (spicy sauce). It is of Cape Malay origin. Sosatie recipes vary, but commonly the ingredients can include cubes of lamb, beef, chicken, dried apricots, red onions and mixed peppers.\n\nWest Africa\nSuya is a spicy kebab which is a popular food item in West Africa that originated in Nigeria. It is traditionally prepared by the Hausa people of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Ghana and some parts of Sudan (where it is called agashe).\nKyinkyinga is common and popular in West Africa. It is a Ghanaian dish, very similar to or synonymous with the Hausa suya kebab, also known as sooya, tsinga, chichinga, tsire agashi, chachanga or tankora.\n\nOther variants\n\u0106evapi\n\u0106evapi (pronounced [t\u0255\u025bv\u031e\u01ce\u02d0pi]) or \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i (formal diminutive, [t\u0255\u025bv\u031e\u01cept\u0283it\u0255i], \u045b\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0438\u045b\u0438), which comes from the word kebab, is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of skinless sausage, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania. \u0106evapi has its origins in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the kofte kebab. A dish with similar origins is in Romania called mititei.\n\nPinchitos\nPinchitos or Pinchos Morunos is a Moorish-derived kebab dish in Spanish cuisine. The name pinchitos is used in the southern Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer (Spanish: pincho) which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due to the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years.\n\nShashlik\nShashlik is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab. It is popular in many countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Baltics. In non-Muslim-majority countries, shashlik and equivalent dishes like Romanian frig\u0103rui may sometimes be prepared with pork.\n\nKebab in Western culture\nKebab cuisine has spread around the world together with Muslim influence. Although non-Muslim Westerners may be increasingly familiar with some of the many other international kebab dishes, only two have become an established and widely popular part of the culture in many Western countries. In English, the word kebab commonly refers to shish kebab and, outside of North America, to d\u00f6ner kebab or related fast-food dishes. These dishes are also served in many other countries, where they may have different names.Kebabs have also met opposition: in Italy, several cities banned kebab shops in order to preserve Italian culinary culture. Many protested against these bans as \"racist\".\n\nShish kebab\nIn English, kebab, or in North America also kabob, often occurring as shish kebab, is now a culinary term for small pieces of meat cooked on a skewer. The word kebab, most likely derived from Persian, has been used with various spellings in this sense since at least the 17th century, while the Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known publication of the term shish kebab, derived from Turkish: \u015fi\u015f kebap, in 1914. \nThere are two etymologies suggested for Shish Kabob in the Persian dictionary of Dehkhoda: Shish being the Persian word \"Shish\" for the number 6, which refers to the original six pieces of meat of a standard Kabob skewer, or \"Shish\" being driven from Late Middle Persian (aka. Sassanid Pahlavi) \"Sich\" meaning a skewer. The word \"Kabob\" is most probably driven from the Arhameic word kb\u0101b\u0101 (to roast).\nIn many English-speaking countries, it refers to the now well-known dish prepared with marinated meat or seafood together with vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers threaded onto the skewer, also sometimes known as shashlik. This preparation is different from the typical Turkish shish kebab style, where vegetables are usually cooked on a separate skewer. Shish kebabs are customarily prepared in homes and restaurants, and are usually cooked on a grill or barbecue, or roasted in an oven.\nThe word kebab may also be used as a general term in English to describe any similar-looking skewered food, such as brochette, satay, souvlaki, yakitori, or numerous small chunks of any type of food served on a stick. This is different from its use in the Middle East, where shish (Persian/Mazandarani: \u0634\u06cc\u0634, Turkish: \u015fi\u015f) is the word for skewer, while kebab comes from the word for grilling.\n\nDoner kebab\nEnglish speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word kebab generally to mean the popular fast food version of the Turkish d\u00f6ner kebab, or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from kebab shops as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.\nThe d\u00f6ner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with pita or other flatbreads. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a D\u00f6ner, though Arab shops there serve shawarma.\n\nSimilar dishes\nSee also\n\n\n== References ==", "pages":

Recipes vary, but generally it has a sauce made of canned diced tomatoes with green chiles (commonly the Ro-Tel brand), cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, diced bell pepper, onion, and chunks or shreds of chicken. The bottom of the casserole is lined with corn tortillas or tortilla chips, then layered with sauce and topped with cheese.

The Yiddish word mandlbroyt literally means almond bread, a reference to its common ingredient of almonds. It is typically formed by baking a loaf which is then cut into small slabs and twice-baked in order to form a crunchy exterior. The cookies were popular in Eastern Europe among rabbis, merchants and other itinerant Jews as a staple dessert that kept well.Its precise origin is unknown, as is its historic relationship with biscotti, a similar Italian cookie. It is made with oil and not butter and so is pareve and can be served as part of the Shabbat dinner.The basic ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs and oil. Additional ingredients vary between bakers, but common additions include almonds, walnuts, cinnamon, chocolate chips or diced candied fruit. Mandelbrot is called kamishbrot in Ukraine, and the two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\nList of cookies\n Food

Dominican and Puerto Rican dish. The dish is prepared differently on both islands.\n\nIngredients and preparation\nThe pastel\u00f3n is a casserole dish consisting of typical Latin Caribbean foods such as plantains, sofrito, and seasoned, mince meat (beef).\n\nDominican Republic\nIn the Dominican Republic this dish is made with boiled mashed ripe plantains. The dish is often called Dominican casserole or ripe plantain casserole using typically Dominican style picadillo and cheddar cheese. A layer of mashed plantain is placed at the bottom of a baking pan and covered with picadillo and cheddar. Another layer of mashed plantain is placed on top with picadillo and cheddar. The dish is then covered with aluminum and baked for an additional 35-45 minutes.\n\nPuerto Rico\nIn Puerto Rico pastel\u00f3n is considered a Puerto Rican lasagna. Sweet plantains are peeled cut lengthwise in to strips and fried. The plantain replaces lasagna pasta. Minced meat is saut\u00e9ed with most notably bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, basil, parsley, olives, capers, raisins, garlic, and wine. Plantains are then placed at the bottom of a baking pan layered with meat filling, mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, bechamel sauce or marinara sauce. This is then repeated about two more times making layers just like a lasagna. It is then baked. Plantains can be replaced with batata or boiled mashed yuca. \nVegetarian pastel\u00f3n is popular as well replacing meat with mushrooms, eggplant, squash, string beans, potato or chayote.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Bechamel sauce", "Caribbean cuisine", "Chayote", "Cheddar cheese", "Cooking banana", "Dominican Republic", "Dominican Republic cuisine", "ISBN (identifier)", "Main course", "Marinara sauce", "Picadillo", "Puerto Rican cuisine", "Puerto Rico", "Sofrito", "Spanish language", "Sweet potato", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Template:Caribbean-cuisine-stub", "Template:DominicanRepublic-stub", "Template:PuertoRico-stub", "Template talk:Caribbean-cuisine-stub", "Template talk:DominicanRepublic-stub", "Template talk:PuertoRico-stub", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from January 2024"]}, "Category:CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list": {"body": "Pommes boulang\u00e8re or pommes \u00e0 la boulang\u00e8re \u2013 \"baker's potatoes\" \u2013 is a savoury dish of sliced potato and onion, cooked slowly in liquid in an oven.\n\nBackground\nThe name of the dish is said to derive from an old practice in French villages, where householders without their own ovens would take the prepared dish to the village bakery. After the baker had finished making his bread, the potato dish would cook slowly while the oven gradually died down.\n\nIngredients and variations\nThe basic ingredients are potatoes, onions and cooking liquid. The dish, cooked slowly in a low oven, gradually absorbing the cooking liquid, has a crisp top layer of sliced potatoes, with a softer mixture of onion and potato beneath. It is usual to season it with some or all of garlic, herbs (particularly rosemary or sage), salt and pepper, and to top the dish with dabs of butter before cooking, but there are several published variations:\n\nDespite the French name, the dish is not unique to France. The Yorkshire-born chef Brian Turner recalled in his memoirs (2000) being given an identical potato dish in his childhood, and Bobby Freeman in a 1997 book about Welsh cuisine gives a recipe for traditional Teisen nionod (onion cake), which she describes as \"the same dish as the French pommes boulang\u00e8re\".When diced bacon is added to the potatoes and onions, and the dish is topped with grated cheese before baking, it is known as pommes savoyarde (or alternatively as pommes Chamb\u00e9ry).\n\nNotes, references and sources\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nBeard, James (1974).

They were a staple during the Great Depression requiring only a few basic ingredients: ground beef, uncooked long-grain rice, onion, and canned tomato soup. The name comes from the appearance of the meatballs, which appear prickly when the rice pokes out of them as they cook, resembling a porcupine.Porcupine meatballs can be made in the slow cooker or baked. They can be served with relish such as red cabbage or radish and mashed potatoes. Leftovers can be made into sandwiches.\n\nHistory\nTo make the dish the rice meatballs were pan-seared and slowly simmered in canned tomato soup. The dish continued to be popular into the 1970s. The recipe appears as \"rice meat balls\" in the 1918 cookbook \"Conservation Recipes\".Other ingredients could be added to the meatballs like green pepper, mustard, celery, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, or other seasonings. The simple tomato sauce made with canned soup could be enriched with molasses and seasoned with chili powder and cumin. A later recipe from 1969 for \"Porcupine meatballs paprika\" replaces tomato soup with cream of mushroom, and adds other ingredients like mustard, or sour cream and paprika. \"Porcupine meatballs Chinois\" was a variation influenced by Chinese cooking techniques and ingredients. Served with peach sauce, the Chinois meatballs are made with ground pork, shrimp, rice and green onion, seasoned with soy sauce and sherry, and steamed instead of being cooked in sauce.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFoods and Nutrition:Ground Beef, Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, August 1980", "pages": ["American cuisine", "Great Depression", "Ground beef", "Horseradish", "Long-grain rice", "Porcupine", "Radish", "Relish", "Rice", "Slow cooker", "Tomato soup"]}, "Magyar nemzeti szak\u00e1csk\u00f6nyve": {"body": "Rakott krumpli (or rarely rakott burgonya) is a Hungarian dish made from potatoes, sour cream, smoked sausage, hard-cooked eggs, and bread crumbs.

It is sometimes referred to as rapure pie, r\u00e2p\u00e9e, or r\u00e2pure. Its name is derived from the French patates r\u00e2p\u00e9es meaning 'grated potatoes'. It is a casserole-like dish formed by grating potatoes, then squeezing them through cheesecloth to remove some of the water from the potato solids. The removed liquid is replaced by adding hot broth made from chicken, pork or seafood along with meat and onions, and layering additional grated potatoes over the top.\nCommon meat fillings include beef, chicken, or bar clams.\n\nHistory\nIt is thought that rappie pie has its origins in the Acadian Expulsion, among Acadians who lived out their exile in Massachusetts. This opportunity to meet and interact with other immigrant groups would naturally encourage a sharing of cultural recipes. It may have been German or Swiss immigrants who taught the Acadians their technique for using grated potatoes in their recipes, but whoever it was, this proved to be an important tip for those that returned to Nova Scotia and the Maritimes when the expulsion was lifted. When they returned, they found that their fertile land had been given to Loyalist New Englanders lured north by the promise of farmland. The harsh, rocky land that remained was excellent for growing potatoes, if little else, so the Acadians used them to fill out dishes made with what game was available.\n\nSee also\nGratin, the French

The origins of tetrazzini are widely disputed. Some accounts ascribe tetrazzini as a creation of Auguste Escoffier. Other sources claim tetrazzini to be invented in the early 1900s by Ernest Arbogast, the chef at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California, where Luisa Tetrazzini made her American debut at the Tivoli as Gilda in Rigoletto on January 11, 1905. However, other sources attribute the origin to the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City.In 1950s through the 1980s, upscale New York City restaurants including Mamma Leone's and Sardi's featured tetrazzini on the menu. The Sardi's tetrazzini recipe was featured in Vincent Price's cookbook A Treasury of Great Recipes, and mentioned in the Sue Kaufman novel Diary of a Mad Housewife. Tetrazzini frozen dinners were popular in the 1960s, as noted by Joan Didion in The Saturday Evening Post article \"The Big Rock Candy Figgy Pudding Pitfall\". Recipes for tetrazzini, both from-scratch and using convenience ingredients, were popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and the dish was featured in an episode of Mad Men. The Unofficial Mad Men Cookbook, a collection of vintage recipes featuring dishes featured in the run of the show. The cookbook included recipes drawn from various popular mid-century restaurants and cookbooks, including a recipe for tetrazzini originally published in Betty Crocker's Hostess Cookbook. In the 1960s, southern restaurants and Junior League cookbooks began featuring versions of tetrazzini (often referred to as chicken spaghetti throughout the south). In the 1960s, the famed Piccadilly Cafeteria in Baton Rouge introduced chicken tetrazzini to the menu, and it remains a customer favorite decades later. Foster's Market in Durham, North Carolina, introduced chicken spaghetti to their in-house dining and catering menus in the 1980s, with their version based upon the chicken spaghetti recipe featured in the Baton Rouge Junior League cookbook River Road Recipes. In the 1990s, tetrazzini and chicken spaghetti emerged as soul food classics.\n\nIn 21st century pop culture\nTetrazzini, specifically chicken tetrazzini, became an Internet meme after a woman on Maury accuses her friend of seducing her boyfriend by preparing his favorite meal, chicken tetrazzini. Clips from the episode were featured on the E! channel show, The Soup, in 2007. In 2020, Vice magazine food editor Farideh Sadeghin prepared chicken tetrazzini for their Munchies series, referencing the Maury episode as her inspiration for the dish.\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\nList of casserole dishes\nList of foods named after people\nList of foods of the Southern United States\nList of soul foods and dishes\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Auguste Escoffier", "Basil", "Baton Rouge", "Betty Crocker", "Breadcrumbs", "Butter", "Cheese", "Cheese sauce", "Cream", "E!", "Egg noodles", "Frozen dinners", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "Italian-American", "Joan Didion", "Junior League", "Linguine", "List of almond dishes", "List of casserole dishes", "List of foods named after people", "List of foods of the Southern United States", "List of soul foods and dishes", "Luisa Tetrazzini", "Mad Men", "Maury (talk show)", "Milk", "New York City", "North Carolina", "Palace Hotel, San Francisco", "Parsley", "Pasta", "Poultry", "Rigoletto", "San Francisco, California", "Sardi's", "Seafood", "Sherry", "Six Times Square", "Soul food", "Spaghetti", "Sue Kaufman", "The Saturday Evening Post", "The Soup", "Vice (magazine)", "Vincent Price", "White wine", "Category:Use mdy dates from August 2016"]}, "Portal:India": {"body": "A sanna (Konkani: \u0938\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0902) is a spongy, steamed, and savoury unfilled dumpling originally made of red rice, black lentil and coconut in the Konkan region, by the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. They originated in Goa and Damaon, Mangalore, Bombay and Bassein (Vasai), and are especially popular among Goans, both the Goan Hindus and Goan Christians, and also among the Konkani migrants outside Konkan in Karachi, Sindh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Kerala. They are also loved by the people of the Konkan division, such as the Kuparis of the Bombay East Indian community.\nHindus normally use urad dal, coconut water and coconut milk for fermentation. Catholic sannas consist of two types: Those made from the toddy of coconut flowers, and those sannas made using the sap-toddy of the coconut palm. Though both of them require the same varieties of rice, sannas are commonly made with coconut for fermentation, unlike idlis that are commonly made by adding yeast. They are made on special days such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Sonsar Padvo/Yugadi and Makar Sankranti, Catholics generally prepare them for church feasts, christenings and weddings. Sometimes a sweet version is made with jaggery, known as godachi sanna (Konkani: \u0917\u094b\u0921\u093e\u091a\u0940 \u0938\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0902, goddachee sanna).Mangalorean Catholic cuisine on special days is incomplete without sannas. They are a much-loved delicacy and are served with bafat, a spicy pork curry prepared with a medley of powdered spices. Sannas are also served alongside chicken or mutton curries, and also with beef before the beef ban in India. They can be eaten for breakfast with coconut chutney or saambhar, or with coconut milk sweetened with jaggery and flavoured with cardamom.\nIn the present day, the unavailability or ban of toddy in certain places and the difficult and lengthy process of extracting fresh coconut milk have made the dish an occasional delicacy, prepared during Konkani celebrations only. Sometimes the dish is completely substituted by idlis, made of white rice and yeast-based batter.\n\nSee also\nFeni (Goa)\nBombay Sapphire\nList of steamed foods\nList of fermented

cuisine, which was created by the French chef Urbain Dubois in the employ of Prince Orloff, former Russian ambassador to France. The dish consists of a braised loin of veal, thinly sliced, filled with a thin layer of finely chopped mushrooms (duxelles) and onions (as soubise) between the slices, then reassembled in the original shape. It is then topped with Mornay sauce (bechamel sauce with cheese) and browned in the oven.Similar dishes are popular in Russia today where they usually go by the name French-style meat (Russian: \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u043f\u043e-\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438, tr. my\u00e1so po-frants\u00faski).

It is a paste made from chili peppers, yuzu peel and salt, which is then allowed to ferment. It is usually used as a condiment for nabemono dishes, miso soup, and sashimi. The most famous types of yuzu kosh\u014d come from Kyushu, where it is a local specialty.\n\nCharacteristics\nThe last pair of kanji in the name, kosh\u014d (\u80e1\u6912), normally refers to black pepper; in the Kyushu dialects, however, they refer to chili peppers. Normally green chili peppers are used, but some versions use red peppers. Yuzu kosh\u014d made from green chilis is green, while using red chilis yields an orange paste.\nYuzu kosh\u014d is described as being mildly spicy with acidic tones from the citrus fruit.\n\nHistory\nOrigin\nThere are theories that yuzu kosh\u014d was originally made in Hita, \u014cita Prefecture and in Soeda, Fukuoka Prefecture.One theory holds that several villages in Hita were the centers where yuzu cultivation became popular, and where yuzu kosh\u014d had been made by families for a long time. Another holds that a garden in Mount Hiko, a mountain located between Fukuoka and Oita and one of the three sacred mountains of Japan, has a yuzu tree where yamabushi first created yuzu kosh\u014d. The process has been passed down through the generations of yamabushi.\n\nPopularity\nOriginally yuzu kosh\u014d was made by families, but mass-produced versions showed up on the market. It grew in popularity after being offered as a souvenir in the hot spring town of Yufuin Onsen. It grew even more in popularity when Fundokin (\u30d5\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc\u30ad\u30f3), a major producer of shoyu and miso in Kyushu, began making yuzu kosh\u014d. Recently it has become available in supermarkets in the Kanto region. In recent years, major producers like House Foods, S & B Foods, McCormick & Company, and Lion have started selling it. A version of yuzu kosh\u014d in a tube has appeared on the market. Tankan kosh\u014d is a similar product using the more orange-like citrus tankan.\n\nUse\nOriginally, yuzu kosh\u014d was used in nabemono, but it is now also found as a condiment for tsukune, udon, miso, sashimi, tempura, and yakitori. Further, since becoming available all throughout Japan, it is being used in various ways such as on spaghetti, salads, tonkatsu, ramen, and shumai.\nLarge-scale manufacturers have also started using the flavoring in their products. Calbee makes snack foods such as potato chips that are flavored as yuzu kosh\u014d, but they are found in only certain locations. Ezaki Glico makes Pretz with the flavoring, and Meiji makes a curly corn chip that is sold only in Kyushu. Kameda makes fried mochi chips and senbei as well. However, as snacks must not have any moisture in them, the flavoring is created by combining yuzu powder and chili powder, and real yuzu kosh\u014d is not used. In Kyushu, Kit Kats with yuzu kosh\u014d flavor are sold.\n\nSee also\nKanzuri\nChili pepper paste\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Agedashi d\u014dfu", "Agemochi", "Amanatt\u014d", "Amazake", "Anpan", "Aquarius (beverage)", "Arare (food)", "Arctium", "Awamori", "Bamboo shoot", "Bancha", "Barley tea", "Beni sh\u014dga", "Bento", "Black pepper", "Boss Coffee", "Botan Rice Candy", "Bread crumbs", "C.C.

The most common variations involve either stir frying or deep frying chicken and topping it with almonds.\n\nPreparation\nSome variations of almond chicken are prepared in a similar manner to cashew chicken, by stir frying chicken with almonds and vegetables. This variation is found in the 1917 Chinese Cook Book by Shiu Wong Chan, which calls for stir frying chicken with onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts and celery before coating with \"Chinese gravy\" and topping with almonds. This is one of the oldest recipes for the dish.Other versions of the dish are prepared by battering chicken and coating it with almonds before frying.\n\nAlmond boneless chicken\nAlmond boneless chicken or War Sui Gai, a variation popular in Michigan, features sliced chicken which is deep fried twice. It is then topped with mushroom gravy and sliced almonds and served on a bed of iceberg lettuce. The dish is strongly associated with Detroit, but is also commonly served in Ohio and parts of Eastern Canada.The origins of almond boneless chicken are unknown, although it was likely developed by Chinese immigrants from Guangdong. It may have originated in Detroit, Michigan and was historically associated with chop suey houses.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["American Chinese cuisine", "American Chinese food", "Cashew chicken", "Chop suey", "Detroit, Michigan", "Guangdong", "ISBN (identifier)", "List of cuisines"]}, "Portal:Singapore": {"body": "Soon kueh (simplified Chinese: \u7b0b\u7cbf; traditional Chinese: \u7b4d\u7cbf; pinyin: s\u01d4ngu\u01d2; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: s\u00fan-k\u00f3e; lit.

The relatively dry puree becomes the dough, which is rolled and flattened into patties. These patties are stuffed with sweetened beaten egg, scrapped flesh of coconut, nuts, raisins and cardamom, a spice which is rolled into the shape of a spindle with oiled palm. The stuffed dough is then deep fried in coconut oil, and is either consumed as a snack or topped with sago-based white sauce so that it can be served as a dessert.\nVariations are made by varying the ingredients used in the filling.

Most recipes include nutmeg and there are also variations using curry powder or that add in finely chopped vegetables such as carrot.The bitterbal derives its name from a generic word for certain types of herb-flavoured alcoholic beverages, called a bitter in Dutch, and are popularly served as part of a bittergarnituur, a selection of savoury snacks to go with drinks, at pubs or at receptions in the Netherlands.Bitterballen are very similar to the more common croquette (kroketten in Dutch) in ingredients and preparation/cooking methods, as well as flavour, though the larger kroketten have a distinct oblong sausage shape, but with a similar diameter.\n\nPreparation\nThe ingredients are combined and cooked, then refrigerated for the mixture to firm up. Once firm, the filling is rolled into balls roughly 3 to 4 cm in diameter, then battered in a breadcrumb and egg mixture and deep-fried. They are typically served with a ramekin or small bowl of mustard for dipping.

High calcium content and high catabolism for alcohol makes it a favorite anju (side dish for drinking).Makchang gui is said to have originated in Daegu and the surrounding Gyeongsang region. King Seonjo of Joseon is said to have enjoyed the dish at his inauguration.\n\nPreparation and serving\nMakchang is usually grilled over a barbecue, but preparation has to be done beforehand to rid the meat of odd odors and excessive fat. The meat may either be pre-boiled in water seasoned with doenjang, onions, medicinal herbs and such, or pre-marinated in a sauce made of various fruit (apple, Korean pear, pineapple, kiwi, etc.) before grilling.The dipping sauce is made from a mixture of doenjang, ground beans, ground red pepper, and chopped scallions.

Assorted fritters are called a-kyaw-sone (Burmese: \u1021\u1000\u103c\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1005\u102f\u1036). Burmese fritters are generally savory, and often use beans and pulses, similar to South Asian vada.\nThe fritters are eaten mainly at breakfast or as a snack at teatime, served at tea shops and hawker stands alike. They are typically served as standalone snacks dipped in a sour-sweet tamarind-based sauce, or as toppings for common Burmese dishes. Gourd, chickpea and onion fritters are cut into small parts and eaten with mohinga, Myanmar's national dish. These fritters are also eaten with kauk hnyin baung rice and with a Burmese green sauce called a-chin-yay (\u1021\u1001\u103b\u1009\u103a\u101b\u100a\u103a).

\u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, romanized: y\u00edros/gyros, lit.\u2009'turn', pronounced [\u02c8\u029diros]) in some regions, is meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie, then sliced and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread, along with other ingredients such as tomato, onion, fried potatoes, and tzatziki. In Greece, it is normally made with pork or sometimes with chicken, whilst beef and lamb are also used in other countries.Gyros is made in a similar manner to other dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Canadian donair, Mexican al pastor, and the Turkish D\u00f6ner kebab.\n\nName\nThe name comes from the Greek \u03b3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (gyros, 'circle' or 'turn'). Some claim that it is a calque of the Turkish d\u00f6ner, from d\u00f6nmek, also meaning \"turn\". However, this is heavily disputed as many claim the concept originated back in Ancient Greece. Regardless, it is generally accepted that the dish originated from Greeks.In Athens and other parts of southern Greece, the skewered meat dish elsewhere called souvlaki is known as kalamaki, while souvlaki is a term used generally for gyros, and similar dishes.In Greek, \"gyros\" is a nominative singular noun, but the final 's' is often interpreted in English usage as plural, leading to the singular back-formation \"gyro\". The Greek pronunciation is [\u02c8\u029di\u027eos], though some English speakers pronounce it .\n\nHistory\nGrilling a vertical spit of stacked meat and slicing it off as it cooks was developed in Bursa in the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire. After the 1922-23 Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks brought their variation with them to Greece. Following World War II, Gyros made with lamb (called as d\u00f6ner kebab by some restaurants) was present in Athens. It was likely introduced by immigrants from Anatolia and the Middle East. The Greek version is normally made with pork and served with tzatziki, and became known as gyros. Chicken Gyros is also very popular however. \nBy 1970, gyros wraps were already a popular fast food in Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City. At that time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced in the US by Gyros Inc. of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still hand-made. There are several claimants to have introduced the first mass-produced gyros to the United States, all based in the Chicago area in the early 1970s, and of Greek descent. One of them, Peter Parthenis, has said that the mass-produced gyro was first conceptualized by John and Margaret Garlic; John Garlic was a Jewish car salesman who later ran a restaurant featuring live dolphins.The Halifax donair in Canada which was based on the Greek gyros was invented in the 1970s by Peter Gamoulakos. Originally from Greece, he started selling Greek gyros (a pita stuffed with grilled lamb and tzatziki) from his restaurant located off the Bedford Highway.\n\nPreparation\nIn Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are used in other countries. Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely. Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb.For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include cumin, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and others. The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical rotisserie, which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or broiler. As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done.The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of spit rotation, thus allowing the cook to adjust for varying rates of consumption.In Greece, it is customarily served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, lettuce, and fried potatoes, sometimes topped with tzatziki, or, sometimes in northern Greece, ketchup or mustard.\n\nSee also\nList of Greek dishes\nList of kebabs\nList of

primarily of cooked rice, yeast, sugar, eggs, and flour; the resulting batter is deep-fried.  It is traditionally a breakfast dish, served with coffee or cafe au lait, and has a mention in most Creole cuisine cookbooks.  Calas are also referred to as Creole rice fritters or rice doughnuts.\n\nHistory\nThe origin of calas is most often credited to slaves who came from rice-growing regions of Africa. A 1653 French recipe, beignets de riz, lends support to a French origin as well.  The name \"calas\" is said to have come from the Nupe word kara (\"fried cake\").  According to The Dictionary of American Food & Drink, the word calas was first printed in 1880.\n\nCreole street vendors, typically women, sold the fresh hot calas in New Orleans' French Quarter, with the cry, \"Bel calas tout chauds!\" (Creole for \"Beautiful calas, still hot\"). These vendors, called \"calas women\", would sell their pastries in the early morning from covered baskets or bowls carried upon their heads.Writers in the first decade of the 20th century refer to the increasing rarity of calas as street food. Though not widely sold, calas continued to be made at home using leftover rice, and was a typical breakfast food in early 20th-century New Orleans.After World War II, while the beignet remained popular, the calas became more and more obscure.  From a breakfast food it evolved into a Mardi Gras and First Communion treat among Louisiana Creole families.  It could be specially requested at some restaurants.  Through the efforts of food preservationists, interest in calas was revived and it began to appear on the menus of some restaurants.\n\nPreparation\nIn early recipes for calas, rice was boiled and cooled, then yeast added to make a sponge that was allowed to proof overnight.  From this a batter was made by adding eggs, sugar and a little flour for binding.  Rice flour was preferable but difficult to obtain, according to Eustis.  A dash of salt might be included, and a grating of nutmeg was a typical addition.  The batter was dropped by spoonfuls into deep, boiling lard and fried until browned.  Modern recipes reflect the changes in available ingredients, cooking practices, and taste.  Baking powder is sometimes used in place of yeast; vegetable oil is substituted for lard; savory variations have been developed.\n\nSee also\nArancini\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPoppy Tooker: New Orleans-Style Calas on YouTube", "pages": ["Arancini", "Beignet", "Breakfast", "Cafe au lait", "Coffee", "Creole cuisine", "Deep frying", "Doughnuts", "Dumpling", "Egg (food)", "First Communion", "Flour", "French Quarter", "Fritters", "ISBN (identifier)", "Lard", "Lolis Eric Elie", "Louisiana Creole French", "Louisiana Creole people", "Lyle Saxon", "New Orleans", "New Orleans Mardi Gras", "Nupe language", "Pastries", "Rice", "Street cries", "Street vendors", "Sugar", "Yeast", "YouTube video (identifier)", "Help:IPA/English"]}, "Portal:Philippines": {"body": "In Filipino cuisine, moron (also spelled mor\u00f3n or muron, the stress is placed on the last syllable) is a rice cake similar to suman. It is a native delicacy of the Waray people in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines, particularly in the area around Tacloban City in the province of Leyte and in Eastern Samar province. Other parts of the Philippines have their versions of it, however. In fact, the moron was adopted as one of Mambajao, Camiguin's locally produced products.Since it is a variety of suman, the moron is cooked with glutinous rice, coconut milk and sugar. The main difference is that moron is gyrated with chocolate tablea (tablets) or mixed with cocoa powder while a regular suman is not. It also has a hint of vanilla and is usually partnered with coffee or sikwate (a native Philippine chocolate drink). With chocolate as its distinct ingredient, it is also called chocolate moron or chocolate suman.\n\nPreparation\nThe common ingredients of moron consist of glutinous rice (locally known in Tagalog as malagkit and in the Eastern Visayas region as pilit), ordinary rice, coconut milk, sugar, chocolate or cocoa powder and melted butter. In preparation for cooking the malagkit and the ordinary rice, both rice types must be soaked together overnight and then ground the following day.  The ground rice is then soaked in coconut milk until it is soft, after which sugar and chocolate powder are added. The mixture is cooked over low fire while repeatedly stirred. When the consistency is thick, the cooked mixture is set aside for it to cool.After the mixture cools, banana leaves are prepared and cut to be used as wrappers.  The recommended amount is two tablespoons of the mixture per banana leaf. The moron is then brushed with butter.  After wrapping, both ends of the banana leaf are tied with string.  Lastly, the moron are steamed for about half an hour.  After the moron is cooled, it can now be served.\n\nConsumption\nMoron is usually sold in bundles of four pieces that are individually wrapped in a banana leaf. Tourists from Leyte usually buy moron as a pasalubong or gift for their relatives and friends.  In the places where moron originated, it is usually served at festivals, birthday parties, and funeral wakes.  Visitors from those parties usually takes home some of the moron. The food is also a medium of exchange for goodwill in Tacloban and the nearby municipalities of Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, Mayorga and Abuyog.Philippine government agencies usually promote and support locally produced goods such as the moron.  The Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines advocated the longer shelf life of food products including the moron to help producers of those kind of food products while the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines conducted trade fairs to develop and promote products, which included the moron.  The Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines meanwhile made a project in Mambujao, Camiguin for the production of moron.\n\nSee also\nBinagol\nMoron (psychology)\n\n\n== References ==",

chikinkatsu)), also known as panko chicken or tori katsu (torikatsu (\u9d8f\u30ab\u30c4)) is a Japanese dish of fried chicken made with panko bread crumbs. It is related to tonkatsu, fried pork cutlets. The dish has spread internationally and has become a common dish served at Japanese and East Asian restaurants worldwide.Like tonkatsu, chicken katsu is generally served with tonkatsu sauce (\u3068\u3093\u304b\u3064\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9), a thick Japanese vegetarian pureed fruit-based brown sauce with rice or miso soup as part of a two- or three-item set meal, or as dinner with rice and vegetables.\nIn Hawaii, chicken katsu is more popular than tonkatsu and substitutes for it in dishes such as katsukar\u0113 and katsudon. In a plate lunch, chicken katsu is generally served on a bed of shredded cabbage, with a well-seasoned ketchup similar to cocktail sauce.In the United Kingdom, the word \"katsu\" has become synonymous with Japanese curries as a whole, owing to the rapid rise in popularity of chicken katsu curry.\n\nEtymology\nKatsu (\u30ab\u30c4) is a shortened form of katsuretsu (\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4), the

Chislic may have been introduced into the United States by John Hoellwarth, who immigrated from Crimea to Hutchinson County, South Dakota, in the 1870s.The dish may have been introduced to South Dakota by Hoellwarth, but is highly unlikely to have been the introduction to the US. Both Greeks and Armenians subjects of the Ottoman Empire came to the US in the 17th,18th and 19th centuries, and even Martin the Armenian, a tobacco farmer in the original Jamestown colony. They would have brought their common food prep ideas with them.\n\nPreparation\nChislic consists of deep-fried cubes of mutton, lamb, beef or venison prepared rare to medium-rare, sprinkled with garlic salt or other seasoned salt, and served with toothpicks. The dish is typically served hot, accompanied by soda crackers. Regional variations exist: in Pierre, the meat is battered; in Sioux Falls, it is lightly dusted with flour before deep-frying and may be served with hot sauce; near Watertown, ranch dressing may be served on the side; while Lawry's Seasoned Salt is preferred near Redfield.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Adam Thielen", "Batter (cooking)", "Belize", "Crimea", "Deep frying", "Garlic salt", "Hot sauce", "Hutchinson County, South Dakota", "ISBN (identifier)", "Lawry's Seasoned Salt", "Pierre, South Dakota", "Ranch dressing", "Red meat", "Redfield, South Dakota", "Seasoned salt", "Shashlik", "Shish kebab", "Sioux Falls", "Skewer", "Snack", "Soda cracker", "South Dakota", "The McClatchy Company", "The Wichita Eagle", "Turkic languages", "Watertown, South Dakota", "Wichita, KS", "Wild game", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from August 2023"]}, "Category:Use mdy dates from April 2019": {"body": "Chugchucaras is the local delicacy of Latacunga, Ecuador, and the surrounding area.

They are balls of battered clams which have been deep-fried. On the Maine Coast, clam cakes are formed into large, flat patties and fried.  \nClam cakes are often served at take-out food outlets or other informal settings as finger food, as part of a meal consisting of several clam cakes, french fries, and cole slaw. This is often served alongside clam chowder. The cakes tend to be eaten dry, dipped in clam chowder, tartar sauce or ketchup.Clam fritters are particularly popular during clamming season when clams are in abundance and it is legal during limited, specified periods for private citizens to dig their own. The surplus of clams must be used up quickly so they do not spoil.Hank Shaw described them as, \"think clam beignet, or donut hole. Only savory. Crispy, golden brown on the outside, pillowy and light on the inside. Steam rises from the first bite. The slightest aroma of brine surrounds you. Tiny chunks of clam nestle themselves in the folds of the pillow, offering surprising bites of chewy meatiness as you down one of these little glories after another.\"\n\nPreparation\nEach clam cake is a deep-fried ball-shaped mixture containing chopped clam (usually quahog) combined with various other ingredients to give it a firm, hushpuppy-like consistency once fried. The batter is made from flour, milk, clam juice, eggs and a leavening agent, typically baking powder. Some recipes may include cornmeal.\n\nHistory\nLocal legend holds that clam cakes were first served at Aunt Carrie's, a seafood restaurant in Narragansett, Rhode Island in 1920. According to this legend, Carrie Cooper invented clam cakes by adding fresh clams to her corn fritter recipe, thus inventing clam fritters. Clam cake recipes are actually as old as the 19th century, and are an old staple of Rhode Island banking crisis cuisine.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nBethune, Meredith (August 17, 2016). \"Meet the Clam Cake\".

The chicken is fried in such a way that the skin is extremely crunchy, but the white meat is relatively soft. This is done by first poaching the chicken in water with spices (e.g. star anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, Sichuan pepper, ginger, fennel, and scallions), drying it, coating with a syrup of vinegar and sugar, letting it dry thoroughly (which helps make the skin crispy) and deep-frying.The dish is often served with two side dishes, a pepper salt (\u6912\u9e7d) and prawn crackers (\u8766\u7247). The pepper salt, colored dark white to gray, is dry-fried separately in a wok. It is made of salt and Sichuan pepper.Traditionally this dish is eaten at night. It is also one of the traditional chicken dishes served at Chinese weddings and other Asian weddings.\n\nSee also\nChicken fingers\nChicken fries\nChicken nugget\nFried chicken\nKorean fried

[s\u016b.k\u00ee\u02d0]) in Thailand, is a Thai variant of hot pot, a communal dish where diners dip meat, seafood, noodles, dumplings and vegetables into a pot of broth cooking at the table and dip it into a spicy \"sukiyaki sauce\" before eating. Despite the name, the dish only barely resembles Japanese sukiyaki, having more in common with shabu shabu and Chinese hot pot.\nThai sukiyaki evolved from Chinese hot pot served in restaurants catering to members of Thailand's sizeable ethnic Chinese clientele, in which an aluminum pot was heated on a charcoal fire at the table and the raw ingredients presented on one big plate.\nIn 1957, a restaurant called Coca opened its first branch in Soi Tantawan, Bangkok, offering a modified version of the Chinese hot pot under the Japanese name of Sukiyaki. Although it only vaguely resembled Japanese sukiyaki, it was a catchy name for it because of a Japanese pop song called \"Sukiyaki\" which was a big worldwide hit at the time.  This modified Thai version proved to be a massive hit, and it wasn't long before other chains started opening \"suki\" restaurants across Bangkok and other cities, each with its own special dipping sauce as the selling point.\nIn Thai sukiyaki, diners have more options of ingredients to choose from, each portion being considerably smaller in order to enable diners to order many more varieties. The spicy dipping sauce (nam chim suki) caters to Thai tastes, too, with much chili sauce, chili, lime and coriander leaves added. The raw ingredients are presented on small plates and are cooked at the table in a gas- or electrically heated stainless steel pot containing broth.

The name comes from the Japanese word tonkatsu.\n\nHistory\nThe dish was introduced to Korea around 1930s during the period of Japanese rule, but the thick, Japanese-style tonkatsu failed to gain popularity. Don-gaseu became popular in the 1960s, with the spread of gyeong-yangsik\u2014light western food\u2014restaurants. The dish, although called by the Japanese-derived name don-gaseu, followed Western pork cutlet recipes such as those of the Austrian Schnitzel\u2014thinned by pounding before being breaded and deep-fried. It was not sliced, and served with bread. Western-style appetizer soup was served before the dish. Don-gaseu developed into two distinct varieties. In 1977, gyeong-yangsik-style don-gaseu with thin meat became a popular menu in gisa-sikdang\u2014drivers' restaurant, similar to transport caf\u00e9, for taxi drivers\u2014with the addition of chili peppers and kimchi as an accompaniment. As gyeong-yangsik restaurants nearly disappeared, this style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in drivers' restaurants and bunsik-jip (snack restaurants). A second style of don-gaseu, with thicker meat and served sliced following the Japanese method, was made popular in 1983 by a restaurant called Myeongdong Dongaseu. This style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in authentic Japanese restaurants.\n\nPreparation and serving\nKorean don-gaseu is different from Japanese tonkatsu in that it is thinner and often served unsliced, thus eaten with a knife and fork, not chopsticks, and is served with demi-glace on top of the fried meat (or in case of fish cutlet, tartar sauce on the fried fish). Common accompaniments include shredded cabbage sprinkled with ketchup-mayonnaise mixture, baked beans, macaroni salad, sweet corn, and danmuji (yellow pickled radish). Green chili peppers and doenjang (soybean paste) or ssamjang (wrap sauce) for dipping the chili peppers, baechu-kimchi (cabbage kimchi) or kkakdugi (radish kimchi), and rice with Korean or Japanese style soup can be served with the don-gaseu plate. Alternatively, bread can replace rice, in which case Western-style soup is served before the main plate as an appetizer.\n\nVariations\nSaengseon-gaseu (\uc0dd\uc120\uac00\uc2a4), a fish cutlet similar to don-gaseu, is served with tartar sauce, instead of demi-glace.\n\nSee also\nList of pork dishes\nTonkatsu, a similar Japanese dish\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Baechu-kimchi", "Bunsik", "Chili pepper", "Danmuji", "Deep frying", "Demi-glace", "Doenjang", "Kimchi", "Kkakdugi", "Korea under Japanese rule", "Korean language", "List of pork dishes", "Schnitzel", "Ssamjang", "Tartar sauce", "The Hankyoreh", "Tonkatsu", "Transport caf\u00e9", "Weekly Dong-A", "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section", "Wikipedia:Summary style", "Category:Articles covered by WikiProject Wikify from February 2019", "Category:Wikipedia introduction cleanup from February 2019"]}, "Portal:Trinidad and Tobago": {"body": "Doubles is a common street food originating in Trinidad and Tobago with Indian origin. It is normally eaten during breakfast, but is also eaten occasionally during lunch or as a late night snack and popular hangover food for local Trinidadians. Doubles is made with two baras (flat fried dough) and filled with curry channa (curried chickpeas) and various chutneys.\n\nOrigins\nDoubles as a dish was created in Princes Town by Emamool Deen (a.k.a. Mamoodeen) and his wife Raheman Rasulan Deen in 1936.It has been speculated that it was inspired by a northern Indian dish called chole bhature (or sometimes channa bhatura). Chole bhature is made by combining channa masala and bhature (poori), which is a fried bread made with maida flour, a common flour in Indian baking.Mamoodeen used to sell curried channa (chickpeas) over single baras (fried flatbread) with chutneys to the Indian sugar estate workers in the early 20th century. When his customers began requesting to double the bara in their orders the name \u201cdoubles\u201d was coined.\n\nPreparation\nDoubles can be served spicy, sweet, or savory.  Condiments include spicy pepper sauce, kuchela, or green mango, bandhaniya, cucumber, coconut, pommecythere, and tamarind chutneys.\n\nCultural significance\nGiven the diversity of Trinidad, doubles is credited with its ability to \"define and maintain symbolic boundaries of identification\", and is considered an authentic standard of Trinidadian cuisine. Doubles is a comfort food for displaced Trinidadians in major cities across the globe. Its consumption has been credited with developing a \"deep psychological imprinting\" among them, and as such is considered culturally significant for how it encapsulated Trinidadian identity into a simple and unique snack.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Trinidad and Tobago\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDoubles Recipe\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C20U1lKOxOx/?igsh=MXkxeWpzNHV3Y2VsYg==", "pages":

{"body": "Xiaolongbao () refers to a type of small Chinese steamed bun (baozi) traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, a small bamboo steaming basket. Xiaolongbao are often referred to as a kind of \"dumpling\", but are distinct from Chinese jiaozi or wonton. \nIn some parts of China and overseas, xiao long bao may specifically refer to a kind of soup dumpling, the tangbao (Chinese: \u6c64\u5305) of Jiangnan cuisine, which are strongly associated with Shanghai and Wuxi. In Shanghainese, these are also known as siaulon moedeu or xiaolong mantou, as Wu Chinese-speaking peoples use the traditional definition of \"mantou\", which refers to both filled and unfilled buns. Shengjianbao are very similar to tangbao but are pan-fried instead of steamed.\n\nOrigins\n\"Xiaolongbao\" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, by Wan Hua Tea House in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960\u20131127).\nThere are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat.\n\nIngredients\nChinese buns, in general, may be divided into two types, depending on the degree of leavening of the flour skin. Buns can be made with leavened or unleavened dough. Those made with unleavened dough use clear water for mixing, the skin is thin and the fillings large. It is frequently made in Nanxiang but is imitated elsewhere, calling it Xiang-style. Steamed buns made with raised flour are seen throughout China and are what is usually referred to as mantou. Steamed xiaolongbao made with partially raised flour are more commonly seen in the south. This means that their skin is tender, smoother, and somewhat translucent, rather than being white and fluffy. As is traditional for buns of various sizes in the Jiangnan region, xiaolongbao is pinched at the top prior to steaming, so the skin has a circular cascade of ripples around the crown.\nXiaolongbao are traditionally filled with pork. More modern innovations include other meats, seafood, shrimp, crab meat, and vegetarian fillings.\nSoup dumplings are created by wrapping solid meat aspic inside the skin alongside the meat filling. Heat from steaming then melts the gelatin-gelled aspic into soup. In modern times, refrigeration has made the process of making tangbao during hot weather easier, since making gelled aspic is much more difficult at room temperature.\n\nServing\nXiaolongbao are traditionally eaten for breakfast. The buns are served hot in the bamboo baskets in which they were steamed, usually on a bed of dried leaves or paper mat, although some restaurants now use napa cabbage instead. The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with chili crisp.\n\nTraditionally, tangbao soup dumplings are a kind of dim sum (\u00e0 la carte item) or \"xiaochi\" (snack). The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with ginger slivers. They are traditionally served with a clear soup on the side. Around Shanghai, \"tangbao\" may be eaten throughout the day, although usually not for breakfast. They form part of a traditional Jiangnan-style morning tea (\u65e9\u8336). In Guangdong and the West, it is sometimes served as a dish during Cantonese tea time. Frozen tangbao are now mass-produced and a popular frozen food sold worldwide.\n\nTypes\nChangzhou\nThe modern form of Xiaolongbao originated from Qing Dynasty. A place named YingGui Teahouse is where people in ChangZhou go to have Xiaolongbao. Xiaolongbao in Changzhou is known for its thin wraps, great taste of its ingredients, and the soup that spills out when taken a bite. Among the types, crab filled Xiaolongbao is the most well known type in Changzhou that are served after the mid autumn festival.\n\nShanghai\nNanxiang Xiaolongbao in Shanghai have around a hundred year of history. They are known for their unique technique of making the wrappers as well as secret ingredients of the fillings.\n\nTianjin\nGoubuli Xiaolongbao is the most famous Xiaolongbao in the northern China. Goubuli is founded in 1858 by a young man named Gouzi, who named his xiaolongbao after himself as Goubuli later. Goubuli Xiaolongbao has strictly 18 wrinkles on each dumpling due to its creator's unique method of making it. Goubuli Xiaolongbao were served to one of the famous queen's mother in Chinese history as a famous dish from Tianjin.\n\nKaifeng\nKaifeng Xiaolongbao, created in Song Dynasty, is also known as soup filled Xiaolongbao. Many famous cooks created their own ways of making soup filled dumplings in Kaifeng and improved the techniques throughout history. Kaifeng Xiaolongbao looks like \"a lantern\" when you lift the dumpling and \"a flower\" when it sits in the steaming basket.\n\nSee also\nExplanatory notes\n\n\n== Citations ==", "pages": ["A-gei",

It is made by coating sliced okra in cornmeal and then frying it.\n\nHistory\nOkra is a staple of the cuisine of the Southern United States, with fried okra being the most popular method of preparation. Okra was first transported to the Americas by slave ships during the Atlantic slave trade. The method of frying okra is believed to have roots in the Congo or West Africa before being transported to the United States. During the mid-19th century, fried vegetables and fritters became increasingly popular in the South which contributed to the popularity of fried okra.Fried okra is popularly served at barbecues and restaurants in the South, especially as part of a meat and three. It is often consumed during the summer, when okra is in season. It has been called \"Southern popcorn\". The dish is associated with soul food, Cajun and Gullah Geechee cuisine. It is included in the Oklahoma state meal, a menu based on the agricultural and culinary history of Oklahoma that is an official state symbol.\n\nPreparation\nThe basic preparation of fried okra is simple, requiring okra that has been dredged in oil and fried. The okra pods are cut into slices and then tossed or dredged in cornmeal before frying in butter or vegetable oil. Either deep frying and pan frying may be used. More complex recipes involve dipping the okra in eggs or buttermilk prior to dredging in cornmeal or cornmeal and flour. Another method of preparation calls for a cornmeal batter that includes beaten eggs. This batter may be seasoned with ingredients such as black pepper and cayenne pepper.Okra can become slimy when sliced. Cutting the okra into small pieces before frying allows it to maintain a crispier exterior texture, but results in a slimier interior. Whole okra pods may also be fried.It is typically served as a side dish, sometimes with a dipping sauce such as remoulade.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Atlantic slave trade", "Cajun cuisine", "Congo Basin", "Cornmeal", "Cuisine of the Southern United States", "Deep frying", "Gullah Geechee", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "List of cuisines", "Meat and three", "Oklahoma", "Oklahoma state meal", "Okra", "Pan frying", "Remoulade", "Side dish", "Soul food", "Southern United States", "United States state symbols", "West Africa"]}, "Trenchcoat": {"body": "Gambas con gabardina (shrimp in a trenchcoat) is a popular Spanish tapa that started to gain prominence in the 1950s, when it was included in the Manual de Cocina, a cookbook published by the Secci\u00f3n Femenina and given to all Spanish housewives after they completed their Social Service, the female equivalent to conscription during the Francoist dictatorship.

Its shape resembles a half moon and it is a representative rice cake of Korean holidays and traditional culture. It is a type of tteok, small rice cakes, and variety of fillings are used\u2014some include red bean paste, toasted sesame seeds, and chestnuts. Songpyeon is traditionally eaten during the Korean autumn harvest festival, Chuseok, where it is often prepared by families at home. It is a popular symbol of traditional Korean culture. The earliest records of songpyeon date from the Goryeo period.\n\nDescription\nSongpyeons are half-moon shaped rice cakes that typically contain sweet or semi-sweet fillings, such as soybeans, cowpeas, chestnuts, jujubes, dates, red beans, sesame seeds, or honey. They are steamed over a layer of pine needles, which gives them a distinctive taste and the fragrant smell of fresh pine trees. The colors typically include white (\ud770 \uc1a1\ud3b8, hwinsongpyeon), green (\uc219 \uc1a1\ud3b8, ssuksongpyeon), red (\uc1a1\uc774 \uc1a1\ud3b8, songgisongpyeon), and yellow (\uce58\uc790 \uc1a1\ud3b8, chijasongpyeon). Songpyeon is typically enjoyed during the Korean holiday, Chuseok, where it is shared amongst family, friends, and neighbors. It is also enjoyed with liquor on this special occasion. \"Song\" refers to pine needles.\n\nCulture\nSongpyeon is quintessential to Korean families' Chuseok celebrations. Traditionally, songpyeon was made by Korean families using freshly harvested rice and then offered to their ancestors on the morning of Chuseok as thanks for the bountiful harvest during charye (\ucc28\ub840; \u8336\u79ae), an ancestral memorial ritual. Songpyeon is also given to other family members and close neighbors. Such offerings are viewed as signs of respect and efforts to avoid bad luck within the family.Songpyeon is used to show gratitude for the year's harvest by placing it on a table with other foods, included newly harvested fruit, and taro. These three foods symbolize, respectively, the fruit of the heavens, the fruit of the earth, and the fruit of the underground.Songpyeon is also said to represent the moon and wishes, which is why people will say their wishes while making and eating it. Many stories describe why songpyeon is in the shape of a half moon rather than a full moon. The most common belief is that Korean ancestors thought that a round-shaped full moon could only wane while a half-moon would fill up. This is considered a sign of abundance and prosperity.  Songpyeon resembles a full moon shape before being folded and transforms into a half moon when folded with filling.One explanation of Songpyeon's half moon shape stems from a historical anecdote from King Ulja's reign. In the anecdote, a turtle once came to the palace with a carving on his back that read \"Silla is half moon.\", which represented a hopeful future for the kingdom.Another Korean anecdote says that the person who makes beautifully-shaped songpyeon will meet a good spouse or give birth to a beautiful baby.\n\nPreparation\nSongpyeon is made by kneading rice flour with salt and hot water until it is smooth in order to create a dough. Small pieces of the dough are torn off, rolled into balls and then indented in the center using a thumb. The filling of choice is placed inside the now hollowed center and then the ball is sealed closed and shaped. The rice cakes are steamed on top of pine needles for about 20\u201330 minutes and then rinsed with cold water in order to maintain their chewy texture. The rice cakes are then blotted dry and typically finished by being brushed with sesame oil.Steaming the rice cakes on top of pine needles gives them a unique taste and scent, and also helps to prevent the rice cakes from sticking together while steaming. As pine trees also produce large amounts of phytoncide, this effectively kills germs, and helps avoid spoiling due to the presence of terpene.According to the Dongui Bogam (\ub3d9\uc758\ubcf4\uac10; \u6771\u91ab\u5bf6\u9451), the most well-known Joseon medical book, the pine needles are also said to have medicinal effects on the food.\n\nRegional Differences\nAlthough the cultural significance of songpyeon remains the same, differences in color, shape, ingredients, and even thickness can be found across Korea.\n\nChungcheong Province\nAs pumpkin is widely grown in this region, Chungcheong Province is known for its pumpkin songpyeon. The pumpkins are dried and ground into a powder which is then mixed with the rice flour to make the dough. The rice cakes are often shaped to look like small pumpkins. The result is a sweet rice cake that is bright in color.\n\nGangwon Province\nWith an abundance of potato crops and oak trees, Gangwon Province is known for its potato songpyeon and acorn songpyeon. These rice cakes are made with potato starch and acorn powder, respectively. The songpyeon in this region are typically flat with ridges from pressing down using fingers and in Gangneung, people leave their handprints on the rice cakes.\n\nGyeongsang Province\nSongpyeon made in Gyeongsang Province are typically larger than the songpyeon found in other regions. A popular type of songpyeon found here is ramie songpyeon, which consists of boiled ramie leaves which are added to the rice cakes to make them healthier.\n\nJeju Province\nA traditional filling for songpyeon made on Jeju Island is sweetened peas. The songpyeon are sometimes shaped with a concave center to resemble a volcanic crater and are often pan-fried after being steamed.\n\nJeolla Province\nSongpyeon made in Jeolla Province sometimes contains arrowroot starch which is combined with rice flour to make the rice cake dough. Jeolla Province is also known for its flower songpyeon which are made with natural dyes and made to resemble flowers either by hand or by using a mold.\n\nSeoul\nSeoul is known for its small, five-colored or osaek songpyeon (\uc624\uc0c9\uc1a1\ud3b8). The five colors\u2014white, brown, pink, green, and yellow\u2014represent the harmony of nature. White songpyeon lacks any color additives, but the other colors are obtained using natural ingredients. Brown is created using cinnamon; pink, by using strawberry or omija syrup; green, by using mugwort; and yellow, by using gardenia seeds.\n\nNorth Korea\nThe traditional songpyeon made in Pyeongan Province in North Korea is seashell songpyeon. The name of this songpyeon is attributed to its seashell shape. Its filling consists of sesame seeds, sugar, and soy sauce.\n\nSee also\nKusamochi, the Japanese form of this dish\nCaozaiguo, a similar Chinese dish\nTteok\nKorean cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nChuseok Holiday Food, SongPyeon\nSongpyeon - Official Seoul City Tourism\nSongpyeon (Half-moon Shaped Rice Cake)\nTraditional Korean Holiday, Chuseok", "pages": ["Acorn", "Adzuki bean", "Arare (food)", "Arrowroot", "Arroz caldo", "Bibingka", "Biko (food)", "Binignit", "Brem", "Bringhe", "Bubur ketan hitam", "Butter mochi", "B\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng", "B\u00e1nh t\u00e9t", "B\u00e1nh t\u1ebb", "Calorie", "Caozaiguo", "Cascaron", "Champorado", "Charye", "Chestnut", "Chunga Pitha", "Chungcheong Province", "Chuseok", "Ci fan tuan", "Cowpea", "Daifuku", "Dates (fruit)", "Dodol", "Dongui Bogam", "Espasol", "Food energy", "Gangjeong", "Gangwon Province, South Korea", "Gardenia", "Ginataang mais", "Ginataang munggo", "Goryeo", "Goto (food)", "Gyeongdan", "Gyeongsang Province", "Hangul", "Hanja", "Harvest festival", "Honey", "Hsi htamin", "Htamane", "Injeolmi", "Jeju Island", "Jeolla Province", "Jian dui", "Jujube", "Juk (food)", "Kalamay", "Kelupis", "Ketupat", "Khao tom", "Khao tom mat", "Kiampong", "Kilojoule", "Kiping", "Klepon", "Korea", "Korea Tourism Organization", "Korean cuisine", "Korean culture", "Korean language", "Kue kochi", "Kue lapis", "Kusamochi", "Kutsinta", "Lamban", "Lemang", "Lemper", "Lepet", "List of rice dishes", "List of steamed foods", "Lo mai chi", "Lo mai gai", "Lugaw", "Lupis (food)", "Mache (food)", "Masi (food)", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Moche (food)", "Mochi", "Moron (food)", "Mugwort", "Nian gao", "North Korea", "Oak", "Omija", "Paelya", "Palitaw", "Panyalam", "Phytoncide", "Pilipit", "Pine needle", "Potato starch", "Pus\u00f4", "Puto (food)", "Puto bumbong", "Puto seco", "Pyongan Province", "Ramie", "Rengginang", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Rice powder", "Rice pudding", "Salukara", "Sapin-sapin", "Sayongsong", "Sekihan", "Shakoy", "Shwe htamin", "Soy sauce", "Soybean", "Suman (food)", "Tangyuan (food)", "Tapai", "Taro", "Terpene", "The Korea Times", "Tibok-tibok", "Tteok", "Tupig", "Wajik", "Wingko", "Yaksik", "Zongzi", "Template:Glutinous rice dishes", "Template talk:Glutinous rice dishes", "Help:IPA/Korean", "Category:Glutinous rice dishes"]}, "Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas)": {"body": "Abel Gonzales Jr. (born November 1969), also known as Fried Jesus, is an \"extreme fryer\" and the five-time winner of Big Tex Choice Awards, an annual contest at the Texas State Fair, and the inventor of several deep fried items including Fried Coke and deep-fried butter.

Now, in Japan, almost all super markets and convenience stores sell kenpi of their own brands. You can get kenpi everywhere. One Japanese manga describes kenpi as an aphrodisiac. A phrase, \"You have kenpi in your hair.\" became famous in SNS.\nKenpi is made from 5 cm strips of raw sweet potato (the purple skinned variety, peeled) that is fried in 160 degree C oil until golden brown and most of the moisture has been extracted from the sweet potato (i.e. the foaming of the oil has stopped), leaving the cooled product crisp. The strips are drained of excess oil. A sugar glaze is made of granular sugar, a trace of salt for flavor, and water that is heated to just short of the hard boil stage over medium-low heat and then poured over the fried sweet potatoes. The strips are then separated, placed on a rack, and allowed to drain of any excess sugar until cool. The sugar sauce typically sugars as it glazes due to having been disturbed while hot or due to introduction of sugar crystals while cooling. Because of the high sugar content, once cooled, the kenpi must be immediately stored in sealed bags or containers to maintain crispness.\nVariations include different varieties of sweet potatoes, inclusion of the skin, different amounts of salt in the sugar mixture, different additional flavorings (e.g. ginger), and different sugar sauce preparation methodologies (i.e. fudge, sugared glaze, clear glaze, and caramelization). Because any sugar sauce can be caramelized, any variety of already established caramel flavoring methods can also be used (e.g. cream, coffee, chocolate, liquors) provided that a hard glaze is still attained. Thus in theory, a peel on, gingered, caramelled, brandy flavored kenpi should be attainable.\n100g of Imo Kenpi has 90 Calories; typical American \"French Fries\" have 141 Calories.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Candied", "French fries", "Japan", "K\u014dchi Prefecture", "Meibutsu", "Omiyage", "Snack food", "Sweet potato", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Template:Japan-cuisine-stub", "Template talk:Japan-cuisine-stub", "Help:IPA/English", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from February 2010", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from December 2023"]}, "Zongzi": {"body": "KFC rice\u2014also known as devil cooked rice, devil's takikomi gohan (Japanese: \u60aa\u9b54\u306e\u708a\u304d\u8fbc\u307f\u3054\u98ef, romanized: Akuma no takikomi gohan), Kentucky takikomi gohan (Japanese: \u30b1\u30f3\u30bf\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u708a\u304d\u8fbc\u307f\u3054\u98ef, romanized: Kentakkii takikomi gohan), and KFC takikomi gohan (Japanese: KFC\u708a\u304d\u8fbc\u307f\u3054\u98ef, romanized: KFC takikomi gohan)\u2014is a variation of takikomi gohan which utilizes fried chicken.

Per its name, the fried chicken used is typically the Original Recipe chicken sold by the American fast food chain KFC, though the dish can be made with any other type of fried chicken. The dish is generally said to have originated in Japan, where KFC is notably popular.\n\nHistory\nAccording to Mashable, KFC rice originated from a 1974 marketing campaign that encouraged Japanese families to cook the dish at home. A similar recipe using the same name was published by English-language Japanese culture website SoraNews24 in 2013, albeit using additional ingredients such as diced tomatoes and shimeji.KFC rice was popularized in December 2019 following the publication of an article detailing its preparation in the Japanese publication Gadget News, and it was popularized online in East Asia and the Western world as a \"KFC rice cooker hack\" for making a simple, flavorful rice dish. Some sources, such as Ilyas Sholihyn of Singaporean lifestyle website AsiaOne, have suggested it was intended as a quick, cheap Christmas dinner, owing to the timing of the article's publication and the popularity of KFC in Japan around Christmas.Despite its name, KFC rice is not actually an official KFC menu item sold in any region. Though KFC does sell rice dishes in certain regions\u2014such as chicken katsu rice bowls in Japan, jollof rice topped with fried chicken in Nigeria, and zongzi in China\u2014these are separate dishes that are prepared differently from KFC rice.\n\nPreparation\nPer numerous sources, including KFC's official global website, KFC rice is prepared by mixing uncooked rice with chicken stock and soy sauce, then steaming it with two or more whole pieces of fried chicken in a rice cooker. The fried chicken and other ingredients impart an umami fried chicken flavor to the rice without affecting the chicken's texture. After cooking, the fried chicken is shredded and mixed with the rice, and the bones are removed. It can be served as-is, though many recipes call for it to be topped with salt, black pepper, or scallions.\n\nReception\nNi'Kesia Pannell of Business Insider prepared KFC rice herself and stated \"it didn't taste as flavorful as I thought it would\" despite her expectations using KFC's 11 herbs and spices, but noted it was \"really easy to customize\", with the additions of hot sauce, butter, and additional soy sauce improving it in her opinion.

Sambal is an Indonesian loanword of Javanese origin (sambel). It originated from the culinary traditions of Indonesia and is also an integral part of the cuisines of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Sri Lanka. It has also spread through overseas Indonesian populations to the Netherlands and Suriname.Various recipes of sambals are usually served as hot and spicy condiments for dishes, such as lalab (raw vegetables), ikan bakar (grilled fish), ikan goreng (fried fish), ayam goreng (fried chicken), ayam penyet (smashed chicken), iga penyet (ribs), and various soto soups. There are 212 variants of sambal in Indonesia, with most of them originating in Java.\n\nHistory\nSambal is often described as a hot and spicy Indonesian relish. However, its main ingredient, chili pepper of the genus Capsicum, is not native to Southeast Asia, but from the Americas. Common variants used in sambal recipes include Cayenne pepper and bird's eye chili pepper (both varieties of Capsicum annuum). These variants are native to the Western Hemisphere and were introduced to the Indonesian archipelago in the 16th century by Portuguese and Spanish sailors during the Columbian exchange.\nResearchers note that the people of the Maritime Southeast Asia were already familiar with a type of hot and spicy relish prior to the 16th century. A hot spice called cabya had become a valuable commodity in the Javanese market as early as the ancient Mataram Kingdom era, circa the 10th century. The 14th century Majapahit Javanese Nagarakretagama manuscript mentions lombok mirah island which is identified as Lombok island, which is also the area that produced a spice called red lombok. In today's modern Javanese, the term lombok refers to 'chilli pepper', yet the term probably originally referred to a native hot spice prior to the introduction of capsicum. The Indonesian languages' terms for 'chilli pepper' are cabai or cabe, yet the word cabya is mentioned in several ancient inscriptions and texts found in Java from the 10th century CE. Cabya is actually a reference to the Javanese long pepper or Balinese long pepper (Piper retrofractum). Historians suggest that prior to the introduction of Capsicum from the Americas in the 16th century, it was cabya that was widely used and cultivated as a hot spice in Java. Cabya is still used in Java, but the overwhelming popularity of the capsicum plants eventually pushed out cabya consumption until it was only used in traditional herbal medication and in making jamu (Javanese traditional herbal drink). Nowadays, the plant is considered rare. Another historian suggests that it was ginger that was used as a hot spice agent in the ancient form of sambal. Ginger, cabya, and andaliman are among the earliest hot spices used in early sambal-like hot relish, followed by the introduction of pepper circa 12th century from India, and finally the introduction of chili pepper from the Americas in the 16th century.The Javanese manuscript Serat Centhini (1819\u20131912) records sixteen sambal variants in Java. The recipe book Mustika Rasa (1967), written and composed by Hartini Sukarno, presented 63 recipes of sambals. In 2017, Murdijati Gardjito, a food researcher from Gadjah Mada University, identified hundreds of variants of sambals in Indonesia; 212 of them have a clear origin, while 43 have an unclear origin. Java has the most of variants with 43 percent of sambal variants, \nSumatra has 20 percent, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara has 8 percent, and the rest are distributed between Maluku, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi.Like many culinary introductions and adaptations in the archipelago, over the years this hot and spicy relish branched off into an assorted array of sambal varieties, localised according to regional taste and the availability of the ingredients. Today sambal is a staple of Southeast Asian households, essential in cuisines of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nPreparation and availability\nTraditional sambals are freshly made using traditional tools, such as a stone pestle and mortar. Sambal can be served raw or cooked. There are two main categories of sambals in Indonesia, they are sambal masak (cooked) and sambal mentah (raw). Cooked sambal has undergone a cooking process that resulted in a distinct flavour and aroma, while raw sambal is mixed with additional ingredients and usually consumed immediately. Sambal masak or cooked sambals are more prevalent in western Indonesia, while sambal mentah or raw sambals are more common in eastern Indonesia.The chilli pepper, garlic, shallot, and tomato are often freshly ground using a mortar, while the terasi or belacan (shrimp paste) is fried or burned first to kill its pungent smell as well as to release its aroma. Sambal might be prepared in bulk, as it can be easily stored in a well-sealed glass jar in the refrigerator for a week to be served with meals as a condiment. However, some households and restaurants insist on making freshly prepared sambal just a few moments prior to consuming to ensure its freshness and flavour; this is known as sambal dadak (lit. 'impromptu sambal' or 'freshly made sambal'). Nevertheless, in most warung and restaurants, most sambal is prepared daily in bulk and offered as a hot and spicy condiment.\n\nToday some brands of prepared, pre-packed, instant or ready-to-use sambal are available in Indonesia in warung, traditional markets, supermarkets, and convenience stores. Most are bottled sambal, with a few brands available in plastic or aluminium sachet packaging. Compared to traditional sambals, bottled instant sambals often have a finer texture, more homogenous content, and thicker consistency, like tomato ketchup, due to the machine-driven manufacturing process. Traditionally made sambals ground in a pestle and mortar usually have a coarse texture and consistency. Several brands produce bottled sambals such as Heinz ABC sambal terasi and several variants of sambal Indofood. In the Netherlands a limited range of pre-packed sambals in glass or plastic jar is readily available from several brands (national and store brands) from almost all supermarkets and tokos.\n\nVarieties of chili\nThe most common kinds of peppers used in sambal are:\n\nAdyuma, also known as habanero: a very spicy, yellow, and block-shaped pepper.\nCayenne pepper: a shiny, red, and elongated pepper.\nMadame Jeanette: a yellow\u2013light green, elongated, irregularly shaped pepper.\nBird's eye chili, also known as cabe rawit in Javanese: a very spicy, green\u2013red, elongated pepper approximately 10 millimetres (0.39 in) wide and 50 mm (2.0 in) long.\nChili peppers known as lombok in Javanese: a mild, green or red, elongated pepper. Green chili peppers are milder than red ones.\nCabe taliwang: a pepper spicier than the Bird's eye chili, similar in spiciness to the naga jolokia, its name is supposedly the origin from which Lombok Island, or \"the Island of the Chili\", derives its name.\n\nIndonesia\nIn the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 212 to 300 varieties of sambal. The intensity ranges from mild to very hot. Some varieties include:\n\nSambal andaliman\nSimilar to sambal lado mudo but with the addition of andaliman pepper.\nSambal asam\nThis is similar to sambal terasi with an addition of tamarind concentrate.

"Leche frita (literally fried milk) is a Spanish sweet typical of northern Spain. It is made by cooking flour with milk and sugar until it thickens to a firm dough which is then portioned, fried and served with a sugar glaze and cinnamon powder.\n\nHistory\nThough various regions claim to have invented the dish the recipe's origin is uncertain, but commonly it is considered to have originated in Province of Palencia from where it spread throughout the country.\n\nPreparation\nAs the sweet used to be homemade there exist many variations on the recipe on how to prepare and present the leche frita. All of them have in common that they simmer the milk with sugar, cinnamon sticks and sometimes lemon zest. In a bowl, flour, sugar and egg yolks are mixed and the sugar milk is poured in. The mixture is stirred until everything is well combined. This concoction is then cooked at medium heat until it thickens. The generated dough can now be moulded into round, rectangular or rhombical shapes, rolled in stirred eggs, covered with flour and then fried. Before they are served they are glazed with sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon.\n\nSee also\nGulab jamun\nFried milk\nFried ice cream\nBread pudding\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Bread pudding", "Calorie", "Cinnamon", "Egg yolk", "Flour", "Food energy", "Fried ice cream", "Fried milk", "Glaze (cooking technique)", "Gulab jamun", "ISBN (identifier)", "Milk", "OCLC (identifier)", "Province of Palencia", "Rhombus", "Simmering", "Spain", "Sugar", "Sweet", "Zest (ingredient)", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from March 2013"]}, "Category:Articles needing additional references from June 2009": {"body": "Mozzarella sticks are elongated pieces of battered or breaded mozzarella, usually served as hors d'oeuvre.\n\nOrigins\nThe history of frying cheese in a batter dates back to at least 1393 in medieval France, when a recipe for fried cheese sticks appeared in Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris. However, food historians believe that medieval French fried cheeses had little in common with the preparation and development of modern mozzarella sticks.Mozzarella sticks likely have their origins in the United States during the 1970s, through a combination of two factors, as per historian Joel Jensen: \"the increasing availability of mass-produced mozzarella cheese beginning in the 1960s\", and the development of new efficient frying technologies to be used in fast-paced food-serving businesses (such as bowling alleys and sports bars).\n\nPreparation\nMozzarella sticks are prepared by coating cheese strings in breadcrumbs or batter. They may be baked or fried in oil. Mozzarella sticks are often served with tomato sauce or marinara sauce. However, they may be served with other dipping sauces such as plum sauce, jalape\u00f1o jelly, ketchup, barbecue sauce, honey mustard sauce, and ranch dressing. Restaurants often serve fried mozzarella sticks with a marinara sauce.\n\nVariations\nPopular fried cheeses other than mozzarella include provolone, Edam, cheddar, and American. Mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce are part of the regional cuisine of New York's Capital District.In many public schools throughout the United States, Bosco pizza sticks filled with mozzarella have become a popular staple.\n\nSee also\nLumpiang keso\nSorullos\nTeque\u00f1os\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["American cheese", "Barbecue sauce", "Batter (cooking)", "Bread crumbs", "Breading", "Capital District, New York", "Cheddar cheese", "Cheese sticks", "Cheese strings", "Edam cheese", "Fried cheese", "Fruit preserves", "Honey mustard", "Hors d'oeuvre", "Italian-American", "Jalape\u00f1o", "Ketchup", "Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris", "List of cuisines", "Lumpiang keso", "Marinara sauce", "Medieval France", "Mozzarella", "New York (state)", "Plum sauce", "Provolone", "Ranch dressing", "Raspberry", "Regional cuisine", "Sauce", "Sorullos", "String cheese", "Teque\u00f1os", "Tomato sauce", "United States", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from June 2009"]}, "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from September 2020": {"body": "The Natchitoches meat pie is a regional meat pie from northern Louisiana, United States. It is one of the official state foods of Louisiana.\n\nIngredients\nIngredients include ground beef, ground pork, onions, peppers, garlic, oil, and a pie shell. Natchitoches meat pies are often fried in peanut oil because of that oil's high smoking temperature. A number of restaurants in the historic district in Natchitoches serve meat pies, and frozen pies are available from grocers in northern Louisiana.\nIt has a savory meat filling in a crescent-shaped, flaky wheat pastry turnover. It is similar to a Spanish picadillo beef empanada. Varieties are found throughout the colonies of the Spanish Empire. The Natchitoches meat pie is nearly identical to the traditional ground beef empanada of Argentina, Empanada de Carne.The meat pie is found all throughout Louisiana, including southern Louisiana which tends to have a spicier version compared to its northern counterpart, but its origins are found to be from Northern Louisiana.  Although found in Greater New Orleans today, The Picayune's Creole Cook Book published in 1901 by The Times Picayune of New Orleans does not contain a recipe for a Natchitoches style meat pie in its list of over 1,000 recipes. Natchitoches meat pies are found in other parts of Southern Louisiana as well as sold at food booths at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, and seems to have spread south from Northern Louisiana.\nThe use of wheat flour as an ingredient is significant. Corn is grown locally. It is a staple of both Spanish and Native American food. Wheat is difficult to grow in this wet, warm climate. Mexican wheat flour could have been imported initially by annual supply convoy over El Camino Real de los Tejas (a portion later became The Old San Antonio Road) or sourced from Europe via the French port on the Red River at Natchitoches.\n\nModern recipe\nIn the modern recipe, ground pork or pork sausage is blended into the ground beef for additional flavor.  Onions, bell pepper and when used garlic and parsley provide aromatics. Ground black pepper and cayenne pepper are added to get attention without being uncomfortable. Flour is added to the browned meat and vegetable mixture to dry, thicken and loosely bind the filling. The meat filling can be used in other foods (e.g., tacos, tamales, enchiladas, stuffed bell pepper et al) but the wheat turnover crust is a defining element. The traditional size is approximately 4 ounces (by weight) on a 5\"-6\" diameter pastry dough (with the dough circles being cut, traditionally, using an empty coffee can). The filling should be made the day before to allow the flavors of the ingredients to meld. Filling, dough and tools should be chilled before assembly. Warm filling will cause the dough to disintegrate.In the first part of the 20th century, meat pies were sold from home kitchens or from carts by street vendors. By 1967, Natchitoches meat pies were produced in commercial kitchens. Now, they may be ordered online.Louisiana Public Broadcasting aired a program January 20, 2007, describing how to make Natchitoches meat pies. It is available on DVD entitled \"A Taste of Louisiana with Chef John Folse & Company:  Our Food Heritage - The Spanish Shows\". An annual Meat Pie Festival, held in September, celebrates the Natchitoches meat pie. It includes pie making demonstrations, a meat pie cook-off, live music and more.\n\nSee also\nCrawfish pie\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nPistolette\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMeat Pie Festival page at Natchitoches online city guide\nOfficial recipe at Natchitoches online city guide\nLos Adaes State Historic Site Archived 2015-05-12 at the Wayback Machine\nState of Louisiana Los Adaes Site Explorer\nLos Adaes at Texas Beyond History\n\"Chicken War\".

They are often eaten with coffee.\n\nSee also\nSalvadoran cuisine\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Ada (food)", "African cuisine", "Agnolotti", "Akashiyaki", "Apple dumpling", "Arem-arem", "Asian cuisine", "Aushak", "Ba-wan", "Baking powder", "Bakpau", "Baozi", "Batagor", "Bedfordshire clanger", "Bibingkoy", "Binaki", "Black dumplings", "Bolinho de chuva", "Bor\u0219 de burechiu\u0219e", "Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky", "Bukkumi", "Burasa", "Burmese cuisine", "Buuz", "B\u00e1nh bao", "B\u00e1nh bao b\u00e1nh v\u1ea1c", "B\u00e1nh b\u1ed9t l\u1ecdc", "Caozaiguo", "Cappelletti (pasta)", "Capuns", "Casoncelli", "Casunziei", "Central Asian cuisine", "Central European cuisine", "Cepelinai", "Cha siu bao", "Chai kue", "Chapalele", "Chicken and dumplings", "Chinese cuisine", "Cho muang", "Cifantuan", "Cilok", "Cinnamon sugar", "Cjarsons", "Coffee", "Col\u021buna\u0219i", "Corunda", "Crab Rangoon", "Cuisine of the Americas", "Curry puff", "Dango", "Deep frying", "Ducana", "Dumpling", "East Asian cuisine", "Eastern European cuisine", "Empanada", "Eo-mandu", "European cuisine", "Filipino cuisine", "Fun guo", "Gamja-ongsimi", "Germkn\u00f6del", "Gnocchi", "Gnudi", "Gondi (dumpling)", "Gujia", "Gulha", "Gyeongdan", "Gy\u014dza", "G\u00fcrz\u0259", "Hallaca", "Halu\u0161ky", "Har gow", "Hingel", "Hoppang", "Hujiao bing", "Idrijski \u017elikrofi", "Indonesian cuisine", "Jalangkote", "Jiaozi", "Jjinppang", "Joshpara", "Kalduny", "Kenkey", "Khinkali", "Khuushuur", "Kibi dango (millet dumpling)", "Klepon", "Kluski", "Knedle", "Knish", "Knoephla", "Kn\u00f6del", "Kochi (kuih)", "Kopytka", "Korean cuisine", "Kozhukkatta", "Kreplach", "Kroppkaka", "Kubbeh", "Kue putu", "Kue putu mangkok", "La Mancha", "La Solana", "Latin American cuisine", "Lemang", "Lemper", "Lepet", "List of dumplings", "Lo mai gai", "Lukhmi", "Mache (food)", "Maize flour", "Mandu-guk", "Mandu (food)", "Mandugwa", "Manti (food)", "Marillenkn\u00f6del", "Masi (food)", "Mataz", "Matzah ball", "Maultasche", "Membrilla", "Mezzelune", "Middle Eastern cuisine", "Mitarashi dango", "Moche (food)", "Modak", "Mohnnudel", "Momo (food)", "Mont baung", "Mont lone yay baw", "Mont phet htok", "Munthiri kothu", "Nagasari", "Nevryo", "Nikuman", "North American cuisine", "North Asian cuisine", "Northern European cuisine", "Oliebol", "Oyaki", "Palt", "Pamonha", "Pampuchy", "Pancit Molo", "Paowaw", "Pastel (food)", "Pasteles", "Pavese agnolotti", "Pelmeni", "Pickert", "Pierogi", "Pinsec frito", "Pirozhki", "Pitepalt", "Poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e", "Pyanse", "Pyeonsu", "Pyzy (dish)", "Qatayef", "Qingtuan", "Raspeball", "Ravioli", "Rissole", "Rivels", "Sacchettoni", "Salvadoran cuisine", "Samosa", "Schupfnudel", "Scovard\u0103", "Shengjian mantou", "Shlishkes", "Shumai", "Silesian dumplings", "Siomai", "Siomay", "Siopao", "Songpyeon", "Soon kueh", "Sorrentinos", "South Asian cuisine", "South East Asian cuisine", "Southern European cuisine", "Strapa\u010dky", "Suanla chaoshou", "Suiton", "Sujebi", "S\u00ec (dessert)", "Tamale", "Tangbao", "Tangyuan (food)", "Taro dumpling", "Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi", "Thai cuisine", "Timphan", "Tortellini", "Tortelloni", "Uszka", "Valdepe\u00f1as", "Vietnamese cuisine", "Western European cuisine", "Wonton", "Xiaolongbao", "Yau gok", "Yomari", "Zhaliang", "Zongzi", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Template:Dumplings", "Template:ElSalvador-cuisine-stub", "Template talk:Dumplings", "Template talk:ElSalvador-cuisine-stub", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from October 2016"]}, "Template talk:Food-stub": {"body": "In the restaurant industry, gueridon service or tableside service is the cooking or finishing of foods by a waiter (or ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel) at the diner's table, typically from a special serving cart called a gu\u00e9ridon trolley.

It is also known as Rikvach in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, Patrod\u00e9 in Karnataka, Patra in Gujarat, Chembila Appam in Kerala, Alu Vadi in Maharashtra (especially in Malvan) and Goa, Patrodu in Himachal Pradesh, Saina in Fiji, and Saheena in Trinidad and Tobago. It is a primary cuisine for the Konkani-speaking Gaud Saraswat Brahmin community (Patrodu). It is made from colocasia leaves (chevu in Tulu, taro, kesuve or arbi) stuffed with gram or rice flour and flavourings such as spices, tamarind, and jaggery (raw sugar).Patra in Sanskrit and its derivative languages means leaf and vade/vado means dumpling. In Maharashtra, it is also called Alu Vadi.In July 2021, it was identified as one of the traditional food recipes from the AYUSH system of medicine by the Union Ministry of AYUSH. According to the Ministry of AYUSH, iron-rich colocasia leaves help to improve hemoglobin levels. The leaves contain phenols, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, and sterols, which help in reducing chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis. The leaves have significant amounts of vitamin C and beta-carotene.Care must be taken during preparation to ensure that the leaves are adequately cooked. Colocasia esculenta is a member of the Araceae group of plants (including caladium, philodendron, anthurium, alocasia, peace lily, etc.), which are all known to contain irritating calcium oxalate crystals. Only through proper duration of steaming/cooking are they palatable. Mild side effects are described as feeling similar to \u201cswallowing sand\u201d or having \u201ca mouthful of glass\u201d, sensations which can be accompanied by nausea, side aches and potential kidney stone formation, in the worst-case scenarios. Many other plants with thick, glossy foliage contain these same oxalate crystals as a natural defense against animals, albeit in varying concentrations, such as Swiss chard, and there are no issues for the consumer. The vast majority of people do not suffer from any issues, as most chefs prepare the taro leaves correctly.\n\nOrigin\nPatrode is originally a unique Himachal dish made from colocasia leaves.

Pone could be made with corn, or some other main ingredient could be used like sweet potato. This style of  bread, eaten cold as a breakfast food, was a staple food of the cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies.\n\nTerminology\nThe term \"pone\" most likely entered English from Native American language terms like apan, oppone or supawn, meaning baked, possibly related to earlier ash cakes baked in hot coals. A \"corn pone\" is usually a small round loaf of cornbread, about the size of a biscuit, traditionally baked in a round cast iron skillet.The batter was also called \"corn pone\" and could be thin and fried on the griddle to make Johnny cakes or thicker to make baked loaves (\"pone\"), or dumplings, called corn dodgers when dropped in stews and hush puppies when  deep fried. Hush puppies were called \"fried pones\" in the 1928 edition of Southern Cooking by Henrietta Stanley Dull, later changed to \"hush puppy\" for the 1941 edition.Isabel Ely Lord uses the terms ash bread, johnny cake, spider cornbread and hoe cake as synonyms for corn pone. Her explanation of the history of these  different terms follows:\n\nAs \"ash bread\" it was baked in the hot ashes of the fireplace, protected by a cabbage leaf, or leaves; as \"hoe cake\" it baked on a hoe in the fields, or on a hoe-shaped board (with long handle) in the fireplace. \"Pone\" is the irregular oval shape the cakes took in these last 2 methods when shaped by the palm of the hand. \"Johnny cake\" was a Northern name, and the cake was usually baked in the oven.\n\nVariations\nThere are varieties on the basic corn pone recipe like apple pones, pumpkin pones and sweet potato pone. The batter can be enriched with sweeteners like sugar or molasses to improve the flavor, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, ginger or grated orange peel, but some cooks consider the addition of sugar a deviation from \"the original dish\". When milk is used in place of water it becomes corn cake.There are hundreds of variations of sweet potato pone in historical cookbooks with rose water, orange blossom water as a dessert, or served as a side dish for pork or wild game. Creole variations typically add black pepper.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["American cuisine", "Ash cake", "Cassava", "Cast iron", "Corn cake", "Corn dodgers", "Corn pone", "Cornbread", "Cuisine of the Southern United States", "Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies", "Dumplings", "Henrietta Stanley Dull", "Hoe cake", "Hushpuppy", "ISBN (identifier)", "Isabel Ely Lord", "Johnny cakes", "Louisiana Creole cuisine", "Pone (disambiguation)", "Sweet potato"]}, "Category:KFC": {"body": "Popcorn chicken is a dish consisting of small, bite-sized pieces of chicken (about the size of popped corn kernels) that have been breaded and fried.

It took two years to be granted, but then General Mills cancelled it the following year.Some sources suggest that popcorn shrimp originated as a Louisiana cuisine, and chef Paul Prudhomme made it famous. However, at least for the name, what Prudhomme invented was Cajun popcorn, which he put on the menu of the restaurant he worked, sometime later than 1975. Prudhomme published a recipe of Cajun popcorn in his cookbook in 1984. It is fritter of crayfish, made by dipping peeled crayfish tails in a batter of eggs, milk, corn flour, wheat flour, and spices, then deep-fryed, and served with sherry wine sauce. He added that shrimps can be used as a substitute for crayfish. Eventually, \"popcorn shrimp\" became associated with Prudhomme. Apart from names, neither Red Lobster's home page nor Prudhomme's book mention the origin of their dishes.\nToday as of 2021 in the US, the words \"popcorn shrimp\" has no live trademark registration for foods, and over 20 companies sell packaged foods by that name.Variations of popcorn shrimp span from heavily breaded styles, to light tempura-style.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nFried shrimp\nList of shrimp dishes\nPopcorn chicken: small, bite-sized pieces of breaded fried chicken", "pages": ["Batter (cooking)", "Breaded", "Cornmeal", "Crayfish", "Finger food", "Fried shrimp", "Fritter", "General Mills", "ISBN (identifier)", "LCCN (identifier)", "List of shrimp dishes", "Louisiana cuisine", "NDTV", "Optical character recognition", "Paul Prudhomme", "Popcorn", "Popcorn chicken", "Red Lobster", "Sherry", "Shrimp and prawn as food", "Technician (newspaper)", "Tempura", "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "The Sydney Morning Herald", "Trademark", "UPI", "USPTO", "United States Department of Agriculture", "United States Patent and Trademark Office", "Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2021"]}, "Portal:Malaysia": {"body": "Kuih seri muka, sri muka or putri salat (lit.\u2009'pretty face cake') is a Banjarese and Malay two-layered dessert with steamed glutinous rice forming the bottom half and a green custard layer made with pandan juice (hence the green colour).

It consists of three raw oysters dipped in an egg-milk cornmeal batter called pastinga, rolled in cracker crumbs (hence the name), and deep fried. They were first served by Italian immigrant Phillip Mazzoni and his brothers in the late 19th century as a free giveaway to their saloon patrons with a purchased beer or whiskey. It is unknown if rolled oysters were actually invented by the Mazzonis, or if the recipe was brought over from Italy with them. During prohibition, Mazzoni's remained open by selling these oysters in their new restaurant and it became a popular food item all over town.  Today, most seafood restaurants and fish fries in the Louisville area will have their own version of these on their menus. Home Run Burgers and Fries had a version that was very popular as well.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Kentucky\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Cuisine of Kentucky", "Kentucky", "Louisville, Kentucky", "Oysters", "Prohibition", "Seafood", "Southern United States", "United States", "Western saloon", "Wikipedia:Stub", "Template:Kentucky-stub", "Template talk:Kentucky-stub"]}, "Category:Eggs in culture": {"body": "A Scotch egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs and baked or deep-fried.\n\nOrigin\nVarious origin stories exist. The Oxford Companion to Food gives the first instance of the name as of 1809, in an edition of Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery. They did not, at that time, have a breadcrumb layer, although by 1861 Isabella Beeton suggested this as an option. According to the Oxford Companion to Food, food historian Annette Hope speculated in 1987 that the inspiration may have been Indian koftas such as the Mughlai dish called nargisi kofta (\"Narcissus meatballs\"), in which a boiled egg is encased in a seasoned ground-meat mixture and then fried.Other claims include the item having been invented at Fortnums. According to Culinary Delights of Yorkshire, they originated in Whitby, Yorkshire, England, in the 19th century, and were originally covered in fish paste rather than sausage meat. They were supposedly named after William J. Scott & Sons, a well-known eatery which sold them.It has also been suggested that they were originally called \"scorch\" eggs, as they were cooked over an open flame, though according to surviving recipes they were deep-fried in lard. 'Scotching' as a culinary process is also sometimes cited as the origin, though what 'scotching' was is open to interpretation, from the inclusion of anchovies to simply mincing meat. Further confusion is added by the large trade in eggs from Scotland in the 19th century, which sometimes involved dipping eggs in a lime powder to preserve them, a process possibly also known as 'scotching'.\n\nPreparation and serving\nScotch eggs are prepared by hard- or soft-boiling an egg, wrapping it in sausage meat, and deep-frying it. It is often eaten in pubs or as a cold snack at picnics.In the Netherlands and Belgium, Scotch eggs may also be called vogelnestje (\"little bird's nest\"), because they contain an egg. One 1880s Scottish recipe also calls them birds' nests.\n\nRegional variation\nThe Manchester egg consists of a pickled egg wrapped in a mixture of pork meat and Lancashire black pudding.Vegetarian versions have also been made.  In 2022, Guinness World Records certified a 18.341 kilograms (40.43 lb) vegetarian scotch egg as the world's largest.  It used an ostrich egg in the center, with a coating made of peas and cheddar cheese.  The Harwood Arms, a Michelin-starred restaurant in London, started selling a vegetarian scotch egg that uses a plant-based meat alternative in 2020, and the next year, the supermarket chain Tesco started selling a vegan version.\n\nNutrition\nA fatty food, a typical sausage-coated Scotch egg has about 200 mg dietary cholesterol per 100 grams.\n\nSee also\nDeep fried eggFarsu magruKwek-kwek, battered hard-boiled eggs popular as street food in the PhilippinesMeatloaf\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==", "pages": ["A New System of Domestic Cookery", "Anchovies", "Annette Hope", "Baking", "Balut (food)", "Bird egg", "Black pudding", "Boiled egg", "Bread crumbs", "Century egg", "Cephalopod egg fossil", "Chalaza", "Coddled egg", "Deep fried egg", "Deep frying", "Deviled egg", "Dietary cholesterol", "Dinosaur egg", "Easter egg", "Egg", "Egg-and-spoon race", "Egg allergy", "Egg balancing", "Egg carton", "Egg cell", "Egg decorating", "Egg drop competition", "Egg fossil", "Egg hunt", "Egg paleopathology", "Egg rolling", "Egg tapping", "Egg tooth", "Egg tossing", "Egg white", "Egging", "Eggnog", "Eggs Benedict", "Eggs as food", "Eggshell", "Eggshell membrane", "Embryo", "England", "Faberg\u00e9 egg", "Farsu magru", "Fish egg fossil", "Fish paste", "Fortnum & Mason", "Free-range egg", "Fried egg", "Guinness World Records", "Harwood Arms", "Humpty Dumpty", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "Ichthyoplankton", "Iron egg", "Isabella Beeton", "Kofta", "Kwek-kwek", "Lancashire", "Lard", "Lime (material)", "List of custard desserts", "List of egg dishes", "List of egg topics", "Manchester", "Maria Rundell", "Meat alternative", "Meatloaf", "Meringue", "Michelin-starred", "Monotreme", "Mughlai cuisine", "Narcissus (plant)", "Nargesi kebab", "Omelette", "Onsen tamago", "Oogamy", "Oogenesis", "Oology", "Oomancy", "Ootheca", "Organic egg production", "Ostrich egg", "Ovary", "Oviduct", "Oviparity", "Ovo vegetarianism", "Ovoviviparity", "Ovulation", "Philippines", "Pickled egg", "Picnic", "Poached egg", "Powdered egg", "Pysanka", "Quiche", "Reptile egg fossil", "Roe", "Salted duck egg", "Sausage", "Scrambled eggs", "Shirred eggs", "Smoked egg", "Souffl\u00e9", "Spawn (biology)", "Street food", "Tea egg", "Tesco", "The Guardian", "The Oxford Companion to Food", "Trophic egg", "Vegreville egg", "Whitby", "Yolk", "Yorkshire", "Zygote", "Template:Eggs", "Template talk:Eggs", "Category:Egg organizations", "Category:Eggs", "Category:Eggs in culture"]}, "Category:Use dmy dates from April 2018": {"body": "Scraps or batter bits or crispies are pieces of deep-fried batter left over in the fryer as a by-product of frying fish, and are served as an accompaniment to chips.

After these preparations, the unfinished dish is topped with small sesame seeds, which may or may not be toasted, hence the name sesame chicken. It is sometimes, but not always, served with vegetables such as broccoli and baby corn.\n\nVariations\nSesame shrimp is also a popular variation of sesame chicken. Shrimp is simply substituted for chicken. Preparation of this dish is the same, with the exception of the degree and length of heating of the meat. Some restaurants serve sesame tofu.  \nAnother potential difference is that chopped almonds may be substituted for the sesame seeds, hence the name almond shrimp.\n\nSee also\nList of chicken dishes\nList of sesame seed dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRestaurant-style Chinese Sesame Chicken\nRecipe for \"Flawless\" Chinese Sesame Seed Chicken\nSesame Chicken -

It is made by grinding soaked mung beans, adding vegetables and meat and pan-frying it into a round, flat shape.\n\nEtymology and history\nBindae-tteok first appears under the name binja (\ube48\uc7c8) in the Guidebook of Homemade Food and Drinks, a 1670 cookbook written by Jang Gye-hyang. The word appears to be derived from bingjya (\ube59\uc7c8), the Middle Korean transcription of the hanja word \u9920\ud865\udf3c, whose first character is pronounced b\u01d0ng and means \"round and flat pancake-like food\". The pronunciation and the meaning of the second letter are unknown. Tteok (\ub5a1) means a steamed, boiled, or pan-fried cake; usually a rice cake but in this case a pancake.\nDuring the Joseon era (1392\u20131897), richer households would dispense bindae-tteok to poorer people gathered outside the South Great Gate of Seoul during times of hardship.Bindaetteok was often eaten in the northwestern part of Hwanghae-do and Pyeongan-do.\n\nPreparation\nBindae-tteok is made with mung bean batter with a filling made of bracken, pork, mung bean sprouts, and baechu-kimchi (napa cabbage kimchi).To make the filling for bindae-tteok, soaked bracken is cut into short pieces, mixed with ground pork, and seasoned with soy sauce, chopped scallions, minced garlic, ground black pepper, and sesame oil. Mung bean sprouts are washed, blanched, cut into short pieces and seasoned with salt and sesame oil. Kimchi is unstuffed and squeezed to remove its fillings and excess juice, then cut into small pieces. The ingredients are then mixed.Washed, soaked, and husked mung beans are ground with water and seasoned with salt to make the batter.The mung bean batter is ladled on a hot frying pan greased with a considerable amount of cooking oil, topped with the filling, and followed by another layer of the batter poured over the top of the filling. Finally, the bindae-tteok is topped with pieces of diagonally sliced green and red chili pepper. The pancakes are pan-fried on both sides, and served with a dipping sauce consisting of soy sauce, vinegar, water, and ground pine nuts.\n\nGallery\nSee also\n\nPesarattu\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Academy of Korean Studies", "Afghan bread", "Aloo paratha", "Aparon", "Arepa", "Baechu-kimchi", "Balep korkun", "Bammy", "Bannock (British food)", "Bannock (Indigenous American)", "Barbari bread", "Bataw (bread)", "Bazlama", "Bhakri", "Bhatoora", "Bindaetteok", "Bing (bread)", "Bolani", "Breads of Finland", "Buchimgae", "Calorie", "Chapati", "Chinese Text Project", "Christmas wafer", "Corn tortilla", "Crescia", "Crispbread", "C\u014dng y\u00f3u b\u01d0ng", "Daepa", "Danbing", "Eish merahrah", "Encyclopedia of Korean Culture", "Eumsik dimibang", "Farl", "Flatbread", "Flatbr\u00f8d", "Flatkaka", "Flour tortilla", "Focaccia", "Food energy", "Frybread", "Gamjajeon", "Gwangjang Market", "G\u00f6zleme", "Hangul", "Hanja", "Hoggan", "Hwajeon", "Injera", "Jang Gye-hyang", "Jeon (food)", "Jolada rotti", "Joseon", "Kaak", "Kabkab", "Kattama", "Khachapuri", "Khubz", "Khubz mulawah", "Kilojoule", "Kimchi-buchimgae", "Kiping", "Korea", "Korean Food Foundation", "Korean cuisine", "Korean\u2013English Learners' Dictionary", "Kulcha", "Lahoh", "Laobing", "Lavash", "Lefse", "List of cuisines", "List of tortilla-based dishes", "Luchi", "L\u00e1ngos", "Makki di roti", "Malooga", "Markook (bread)", "Matzah", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Meat jun", "Mekitsa", "Memil-buchimgae", "Middle Korean", "Msemen", "Mung bean", "Mung bean sprout", "Naan", "Namdaemun", "National Institute of Korean Language", "Ngome (bread)", "Pajeon", "Pancake", "Pane carasau", "Papadam", "Paratha", "Parotta", "Pathiri", "Pesarattu", "Phitti", "Piadina", "Piaya (food)", "Pihta", "Pita", "Pizza", "Pletzel", "Podp\u0142omyk", "Pteridium aquilinum", "Puran poli", "Puri (food)", "Pyongan Province", "Qistibi", "Qutab", "Ramazan pidesi", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Roti", "Roti canai", "Roti prata", "Rumali roti", "Sa (Mandaeism)", "Sabaayad", "Sacramental bread", "Saj bread", "Sanchuisanda", "Sangak", "Scaccia", "Sesame oil", "Shaobing", "Sheermal", "Shelpek", "Shotis puri", "Somun", "Standard Korean Language Dictionary", "Taboon bread", "Taftan (bread)", "Talo (food)", "Tandoor bread", "Tandyr nan", "Tapioca", "Tarte flamb\u00e9e", "Thalipeeth", "Thrillist", "Torta de gazpacho", "Tortilla de rescoldo", "Tteok", "Tunnbr\u00f6d", "Zhingyalov hats", "Wikipedia:Contents/Portals", "Template:Buchimgae", "Template:Flatbreads", "Template talk:Buchimgae", "Template talk:Flatbreads", "Help:IPA/Korean", "Category:Flatbreads", "Portal:Food", "Portal:Korea"]}, "Template talk:Nepal-cuisine-stub": {"body": "Tarua is a dish of thinly sliced vegetables coated with rice batter and deep fried.

The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.\nGenerally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at b\u014dnenkai, Japanese year-end parties.\n\nIngredients\nThinly sliced beef is usually used for sukiyaki, although in the past, in certain parts of the country (notably Hokkaid\u014d and Niigata) pork was also popular.\nPopular ingredients cooked with the beef are:\n\nTofu (usually seared firm tofu).\nNegi (a type of scallion).\nLeafy vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and shungiku (garland chrysanthemum leaves).\nMushrooms such as shiitake and enokitake.\nGlass noodles made out of konnyaku or corm such as ito konnyaku or shirataki noodles.Boiled wheat udon or mochi (rice-cakes) are sometimes added, usually at the end to soak up the broth.\n\nPreparation\nSukiyaki is a one-pot dish (nabemono) that was developed during the Meiji era. Different regions have different ways of preparing sukiyaki. There are two main styles, the Kanto style from eastern Japan and Kansai style from western Japan.\nIn the Kanto style, warishita (a mixture of sake, soy sauce, sugar, mirin and dashi) is poured and heated in a pot, then meat, vegetables and other ingredients are added and simmered together. In Kansai-style sukiyaki, meat is heated in the pot first. When the meat is almost cooked, sugar, sake and soy sauce are added, then vegetables and other ingredients are added last.\nThe vegetables and meat used are different between the two styles. Because beef was expensive in the past, the use of pork was common in northern and eastern regions. Other ingredients added to modern sukiyaki include chicken (tori-suki), fish (uo-suki or oki-suki), udon noodles (udon-suki), negi, shiitake mushrooms, shirataki and slightly grilled tofu. In both styles, raw eggs are used as a dipping sauce and steamed rice with black sesame seeds is served.\n\nHistory\nThere are various traditions about sukiyaki. Some concern the name. A theory about the origin of the name is from the word suki (\u92e4), which means spade, and yaki (\u713c\u304d) which is the verb to grill. During the Edo period (1603\u20131868), farmers used  suki to cook things like fish and tofu. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868\u20131912). Another theory is that the name comes from the word sukimi (\u5265\u304d\u8eab), which means \"thinly sliced meat\".Another tradition concerns the history of sukiyaki. Buddhism was introduced to Japan during the Asuka period. At that time, killing animals was against Buddhist law. Also eating beef was prohibited since cattle were considered work animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances such as when they were sick or at special events like b\u014dnenkai, the year-end drinking party. During the Edo period eating game such as boar and duck was common and not forbidden. In the 1860s, when Japan opened its ports to foreign merchants, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was a popular way to serve them. At first, cattle were imported from neighboring countries like Sukiyaki possibly originated and became popular in the Kansai region. Following the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, many beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed and many people in Kant\u014d temporarily moved to the Osaka area.  While the people of Kant\u014d were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kant\u014d, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular. Beef is the primary ingredient in today's sukiyaki.Sukiyaki became prominent in U.S. Japanese restaurants by the 1930s. In 1978 W.L. Taitte stated in Texas Monthly that sukiyaki was \"the most famous but hardly the most characteristic Japanese dish.\" By the 1980s, in the U.S., sukiyaki was becoming obscure as sushi became more prominent.\n\nTrivia\nThe 1961 song \"Ue wo Muite Aruk\u014d\" was given the alternative title \"Sukiyaki\" so that it could be short and recognizably Japanese in English-speaking countries alike. Despite the title, the lyrics have no connection to sukiyaki.Swedish comedian and singer Povel Ramel wrote a song, the \"Sukiyaki Syndrome\", wherein the restaurant customer wants Sukiyaki. There are a number of variations, each with a long description, so long that by the time he orders any of them, the restaurant has run out.\n\nRelated dishes\nShabu-shabu is similar, but whereas sukiyaki is considered sweeter, shabu-shabu is more savory. Shabu-shabu meat is even more thinly sliced and the individual slices of meat are cooked by dipping into simmering liquid at the table, while sukiyaki is cooked in a more casserole style.\nSukiyaki in Laos takes the form of a bowl of bean thread noodles, various vegetables, thinly sliced beef and other meats or seafood, sukiyaki sauce, and a raw egg in beef broth. The sukiyaki sauce is made from coconut, fermented tofu, tahini, peanut butter, sugar, garlic, lime, and spices.\nThai suki or Thai sukiyaki is a very popular hot pot dish in Thailand and, increasingly, neighboring countries.  Despite the name, it bears only a vague resemblance to Japanese sukiyaki.\nHot pot\nFondue Bourguignonne and fondue chinoise\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese soups and stews\nGyudon\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\nA Taste of Japan, Donald Richie, Kodansha, 2001.

The potato-based flavoured snack took their name from the characteristic shape of the crisps.\nPeaking in popularity during the 1970s, Toobs were considered a novelty crisp and could be found in supermarkets and selected convenience stores. They were available in a number of flavours including Chicken, Oriental, Oats and Mexican Party, but more recently were only available in the original tomato flavour.Availability has been inconsistent. Toobs were unavailable from 2001 to 2007, and again from 2015 to 2021.\n\nProduction cease 2001 and return\nProduction ceased in 2001, but resumed in 2007 with the new name \"Tasty Toobs\". The Herald Sun attributed a resurgence in popularity of the rings and the Samboy potato chips to the global economic recession.The product gained some media attention when its Wikipedia page was vandalized in 2014.The Smith's Snackfood Company ceased production of Toobs in 2015 due to poor consumer demand.On 27 October 2015, as bags of Tasty Toobs became scarce, Melbourne radio duo Lucy and Kel announced on air they would give away their last bags of Tasty Toobs to a listener.\n\n2015 campaign to bring back Toobs\nAfter the announcement of the discontinuation of Toobs in 2015, there was a public outcry. Cricketer Shane Warne attempted to start a campaign on Twitter to bring back Toobs using hashtags #BringBackToobs and #savetoobs. However, the company was adamant, noting that despite the sentiment, actual sales were the issue: Smith's Consumer Information Centre stated that \"Consumer demand for the tangy, tomatoey treat has declined and it is no longer possible to justify on-going production.\"\n\n2021 return\nIn May 2021, Smith's announced they might be considering bringing Toobs back into production.\nAfter six years of absence, Smiths confirmed that Tasty Toobs are officially back, with 35g and 150g bags appearing on shelves across Australia from 27 July 2021.Initial sales were brisk, with some stores running out of stock and people offering very expensively priced packs on eBay. In August 2021, Smiths announced that the return of Toobs would only be a limited edition, available for six months. This initial run was all manufactured overseas.  In December 2021 it was reported that Tasty Toobs would make a permanent return across Australian stores, and that production would be split across two locations. The Australian-made version, available only in New South Wales and Queensland, is said to have a \"firmer bite\" and became available from 20 December 2021.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["2021 Frito-Lay strike", "500 Park Avenue", "7 Up", "Albert Cranum", "Alberto Ibarg\u00fcen", "Aquafina", "Baconzitos", "Baja Blast", "Bluebird Foods", "Brisk (drink)", "Bubly Sparkling Water", "Burger Rings", "Caleb Bradham", "California Pizza Kitchen", "Cap'n Crunch", "Cheetos", "Chester Cheetah", "Chevys Fresh Mex", "Cola wars", "Concordia (drink)", "Convenience store", "Copella", "Cracker Jack", "CytoSport", "D'Angelo Grilled Sandwiches", "Diet Mountain Dew", "Diet Pepsi", "Dina Dublon", "Dole plc", "Donald M.

It is a deep-fried, sugar-coated cylindrical pastry filled with crema catalana.Commonly eaten for breakfast or tea, it is honored as Producte de la Terra (English: Product of the home country) by the Department of Agriculture, Farming and Fishing of the Government of Catalonia.\nIt is assumed that this pastry originated in 1920s Girona in a pastry shop owned by Emili Puig in the Street Cort Reial. A French pastry shop showed Puig the preparation of cream-filled pastry and this inspired him to create the Xuixo.\nThis pastry is very popular not only in Girona but has been also accepted in the surrounding areas and can also be found in Tarragona, Castell\u00f3n de la Plana and Valencia.\nIn the second half of the 20th century it was one of the most demanded product in the Xurreries (pastry shops, Spanish: churrer\u00edas) and nowadays it is commercialized by a candy brand that sells them not plain but with a chocolate icing.\n\nThe legend\nAccording to a legend in Girona the invention of the Xuixo has to be credited to el Tarl\u00e0, a very sympathetic person that is very present in the legends of this area. This acrobat that entertained the citizens in a quarantine during an epidemic, fell in love with the daughter of a pastry chef. Once when he visited his beloved girl her father appeared and he hid in a bag of flour. Unfortunately he sneezed (which sounds like xui-xui) and was discovered. Before the pastry chef could get angry he promised to marry his daughter and give him the recipe of a special pastry: the Xuixo. He named it after the sneeze that betrayed him.\nNowadays a figure of el Tarl\u00e0 can be seen every year during the spring festivities when its copy is erected at the place where he had entertained the people of Girona.\n\nThe popular Xuixo procession\nThe foundation \"Fundaci\u00f3 Oncolliga Girona\" and the government of Girona organize the popular procession Marxa del Xuixo. It is a procession in which the whole family participates and strolls through the streets of Girona to discover the city's natural surroundings.

It has its origins in medieval England, with early recipes making use of dried fruit, suet, breadcrumbs, flour, eggs and spice, along with liquid such as milk or fortified wine. Later, recipes became more elaborate. In 1845, cookery writer Eliza Acton wrote the first recipe for a dish actually called \"Christmas pudding\".\nThe dish is sometimes known as plum pudding (though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit). The word \"plum\" was used then for what has been called a \"raisin\" since the 18th century, and the pudding does not in fact contain plums in the modern sense of the word.\n\nBasics\nSome households have their own recipes for Christmas pudding, which may be handed down through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients \u2014 notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with suet. The pudding is very dark, almost black in appearance due to the dark sugars and black treacle in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, brandy and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark beers such as mild, stout or porter).\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth, and often represented as round. The Victorian era fashion involved putting the mixture into a basin and then steaming it, followed by unwrapping the pudding, placing it on a platter, and decorating the top with a sprig of holly.Initial cooking usually involves steaming for many hours. Most pre-twentieth century recipes assume that the pudding will then be served immediately, but in the second half of the twentieth century, it became more usual to reheat puddings on the day of serving, and recipes changed slightly to allow for maturing. To serve, the pudding is reheated by steaming once more, and may be dressed with warm brandy which is set alight. It can be eaten with hard sauce (usually brandy butter or rum butter), cream, lemon cream, ice cream, custard, or sweetened b\u00e9chamel, and is sometimes sprinkled with caster sugar.\n\nHistory\nLegends\nThere is a popular myth that plum pudding's association with Christmas goes back to a custom in medieval England that the \"pudding should be made on the 25th Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the Magi and their journey in that direction\". However, recipes for plum puddings appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. One of the earliest plum pudding recipes is given by Mary Kettilby in her 1714 book A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery. There is a popular and wholly unsubstantiated myth that in 1714, George I of Great Britain (sometimes known as the Pudding King) requested that plum pudding be served as part of his royal feast in his first Christmas in England.\n\nAncestors\nChristmas pudding's possible ancestors include savoury puddings such as those in Harley MS 279, croustades, malaches whyte, creme boiled (a kind of stirred custard), and sippets. Various ingredients and methods of these older recipes appear in early plum puddings. An early example of a bag pudding (without fruit) is \"fraunche mele\" in the Liber Cure Cocorum Pudding \"had the great merit\" of not needing to be cooked in an oven, something \"most lower class households did not have\". Pudding predecessors often contained meat, as well as sweet ingredients, and prior to being steamed in a cloth the ingredients may have been stuffed into the gut or stomach of an animal, like haggis or sausages.As techniques for meat preserving improved in the 18th century, the savoury element of both the mince pie and the plum pottage diminished as the sweet content increased. People began adding dried fruit and sugar. The mince pie kept its name, though the pottage was increasingly referred to as plum pudding. As plum pudding, it became widespread as a feast dish, not necessarily associated with Christmas, and usually served with beef. It makes numerous appearances in 18th century satire as a symbol of Britishness, including the Gilray cartoon, The Plumb-pudding in danger.\n\nVictorian era\nIt was not until the 1830s that a boiled cake of flour, fruits, suet, sugar and spices, all topped with holly, made a definite appearance, becoming more and more associated with Christmas.  In her bestselling 1845 book Modern Cookery for Private Families, the East Sussex cook Eliza Acton was the first to refer to it as \"Christmas Pudding\".\n\nBritish Empire\nThe custom of eating Christmas pudding was carried to many parts of the world by British colonists. It is a common dish in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. Throughout the colonial period, the pudding was a symbol of unity throughout the British Empire.In 1927, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB) wrote a letter to the Master of the Royal Household, requesting a copy of the recipe used to make the Christmas pudding for the royal family. The King and Queen granted Leo Amery, the head of the EMB, permission to use the recipe in a publication in the following November. The royal chef, Henry C\u00e9dard, provided it. In order to distribute the recipe, the EMB had to overcome two challenges: size and ingredients. First, the original recipe was measured to serve 40 people, including the entire royal family and their guests. The EMB was challenged to rework the recipe to serve only 8 people. Second, the ingredients used to make the pudding had to be changed to reflect the ideals of the Empire. The origins of each ingredient were carefully manipulated to represent some of the Empire's many colonies. Brandy from Cyprus and nutmeg from the West Indies, which had been inadvertently forgotten in previous recipes, made special appearances. However, there were a number of colonies that produced the same foodstuffs. The final recipe included Australian currants, South African stoned raisins, Canadian apples, Jamaican rum and English Beer, among other ingredients all sourced from somewhere in the Empire. After finalising the ingredients, the royal recipe was sent out to national newspapers and to popular women's magazines. Copies were also printed and handed out to the public for free. The recipe was a phenomenal success, as thousands of requests for the recipe flooded the EMB office.In 1931, an annual Christmas market for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 and 25 November. A 10-ton Christmas pudding, the largest ever created up until that time, was featured. The recipe became known as the \"Prince of Wales' Empire Christmas Pudding\". The Times newspaper noted \"The Lord Mayor of London has promised to give the pudding its first 'stir'. He will be followed by the High Commissioners of the Dominions, and afterwards the general public will have the chance of stirring it\". The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was then a patron of the PDSA charity. It was then divided up into 11,208 smaller puddings, which were distributed amongst the poor throughout the country. Manchester and Salford, for example, received 512 each.\n\nUnited States\nIn America, the tradition of the Christmas pudding had already arrived in pre-independence days. A book entitled The Williamsburg Art of Cookery by Helen Bullock was published in the U.S. as early as 1742. Among the ingredients she includes a pound of each of a variety of dried fruits and sugar, plus half a pound each of candied peel (citron, orange and lemon). She also adds one pint of brandy and 12 eggs. \nJane Cunningham Croly published a 19th-century recipe for plum pudding contributed to Jennie June's American Cookery Book by the American poet sisters Alice Cary and Phoebe Cary. It was made as bread pudding, by soaking stale bread in milk then adding suet, candied citron, nutmeg, eggs, raisins and brandy. It was a moulded dessert, cooked in boiling water for several hours, and served with a sweet wine sauce.\n\nWishing and other traditions\nIt was in the late Victorian era that 'Stir up Sunday' (the fifth Sunday before Christmas) began to be associated with the making of Christmas pudding. The collect this Sunday in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer begins with the words \"Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works...\". This led to the custom of preparing Christmas puddings on that day which became known as Stir-up Sunday, associated with the stirring of the Christmas pudding.Initially probably a schoolchild joke, latterly the day became known as \"Stir-up Sunday\". By the 1920s, the custom was established that everyone in the household, or at least every child (and sometimes the servants), gave the mixture a stir and made a wish while doing so.It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them. The usual choice was a silver threepence or a sixpence. The coin was believed to bring wealth in the coming year, and came from an earlier tradition of putting tokens in a cake, which had died out by the twentieth century (see Twelfth Cake).\nOther tokens are also known to have been included, such as a tiny wishbone (to bring good luck), a silver thimble (for thrift) or an anchor (to symbolise safe harbour).Once turned out of its basin, decorated with holly, doused in brandy (or occasionally rum), and flamed (or \"fired\"), the pudding is traditionally brought to the table ceremoniously, and greeted with a round of applause. In 1843, Charles Dickens describes the scene in A Christmas Carol:\n\nMrs Cratchit left the room alone \u2013 too nervous to bear witnesses \u2013 to take the pudding up and bring it in... Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper which smells like a washing-day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that. That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs Cratchit entered \u2013 flushed, but smiling proudly \u2013 with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Spruce Eats: Traditional Christmas Pudding Recipe", "pages": ["A.

It is commonly flamb\u00e9ed in North America.\n\nEtymology\nThe dishes are named for the frying pan in which they are prepared, called a \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 : sagan\u00e1ki, which is a diminutive of \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9 : sag\u00e1ni, a frying pan with two handles, which comes from the Turkish word sahan 'copper dish', itself borrowed from Arabic \u0635\u062d\u0646 (\u1e63a\u1e25n).\n\nDescription\nThe cheese used in saganaki is usually graviera, kefalograviera, halloumi, kasseri, kefalotyri, or sheep's milk feta cheese. Regional variations include the use of formaela cheese in Arachova, halloumi in Cyprus, and vlahotiri in Metsovo. The cheese is melted in a small frying pan until it is bubbling and generally served with lemon juice and pepper. It is eaten with bread.Other dishes cooked in a saganaki pan include shrimp saganaki (Greek: \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, gar\u00eddes sagan\u00e1ki), and mussels saganaki (Greek: \u03bc\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, m\u00fddia sagan\u00e1ki), which are typically feta-based and include a spicy tomato sauce.\n\nNorth American serving style\nIn many Greek restaurants in the United States and Canada, after the saganaki cheese is fried, it is flamb\u00e9ed at table (often with a shout of \"opa!\"), after which the flames usually are extinguished with a squeeze of lemon juice. This is called \"flaming saganaki\" and apparently originated in 1968 at the Parthenon restaurant in Chicago's Greektown, based on the suggestion of a customer.\n\nSee also\nLeip\u00e4juusto\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of Greek dishes\nSaganaki cheese\nSma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Aligot", "Alivenci", "Almogrote", "Arachova", "Arizona cheese crisp", "Babiniotis Dictionary", "Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich", "Bagel and cream cheese", "Baked potato", "Barfi", "Beer cheese (spread)", "Bread", "Breakfast sandwich", "Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky", "Calzone", "Carbonara", "Carrozza (sandwich)", "Cauliflower cheese", "Cervelle de canut", "Cheese and crackers", "Cheese and pickle sandwich", "Cheese bun", "Cheese dog", "Cheese dream", "Cheese fries", "Cheese on toast", "Cheese pudding", "Cheese puffs", "Cheese roll", "Cheese sandwich", "Cheese slaw", "Cheese spread", "Cheeseburger", "Cheesecake", "Cheesesteak", "Chhena gaja", "Chhena jalebi", "Chhena kheeri", "Chhena poda", "Chicago", "Chicharron de queso", "Chile con queso", "Ch\u00e8vre chaud", "Croissan'Wich", "Croque monsieur", "Cuban sandwich", "Curd snack", "Cyprus", "Dagwood sandwich", "Diminutive", "Empanada", "Feta", "Flamb\u00e9", "Fondue", "Formaela", "Frico", "Fried cheese", "Frito pie", "Frying pan", "Goug\u00e8re", "Gratin", "Graviera", "Greece", "Greek cuisine", "Greek language", "Greektown, Chicago", "Grilled cheese", "Gujia", "Gulab jamun", "Halloumi", "Ham and cheese sandwich", "Hauskyjza", "Hors d'oeuvre", "ISBN (identifier)", "Insalata Caprese", "Jalape\u00f1o popper", "Jucy Lucy", "Kaasstengels", "Kasseri", "Kasseropita", "Kefalograviera", "Kefalotyri", "Khachapuri", "Khira sagara", "Lasagna", "Lazy varenyky", "Leip\u00e4juusto", "Lemon", "Lemon juice", "Liptauer", "List of Greek dishes", "List of cheese dishes", "List of cheese soups", "List of hors d'oeuvre", "Macaroni and cheese", "Macaroni schotel", "Machas a la parmesana", "Malakoff (food)", "Mattar paneer", "McMuffin", "Meatloaf", "Metsovo", "Monte Cristo sandwich", "Moretum", "Mornay sauce", "Mote de queso", "Mozzarella sticks", "Nachos", "Obatzda", "Opa!

It is popular in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a federal state in southern Germany. The Apfelk\u00fcchle has spread throughout Europe and the US. It is similar to an apple fritter but is made more like a pancake, and can be prepared in several ways. While it is traditionally eaten as a complete meal, because of its sweet taste, Apfelk\u00fcchle has also become popular as a dessert.\n\nEtymology\nThe word Apfelk\u00fcchle consists of two words: Apfel, meaning apple, and K\u00fcchle, a diminutive in Swabian German of Kuchen, meaning cake. A possible translation is little apple pie.\n\nHistory\nIt is not completely certain when Apfelk\u00fcchle were first made, however it is known that the pastry was created in south-west Germany in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where it has been a long-standing traditional meal. Recently, Apfelk\u00fcchle has spread beyond Germany's borders and has become very popular.\n\nSeason\nApples do not tend to tolerate long storage through the colder seasons. Making Apfelk\u00fcchle is a way to use the spare apples picked in the summer and early autumn. A large number of apples that would otherwise be wasted or were slightly damaged before they could be eaten (either en route to the vendor or damaged during harvest), can be used to make Apfelk\u00fcchle.\n\nFat Thursday\nApfelk\u00fcchle is traditionally eaten in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on Fat Thursday, the Thursday prior to Rose Monday (Carnival Monday), similar to eating paczki on Fat Tuesday. Apfelk\u00fcchle is traditionally eaten as a main course, however in recent years it has often been served as a dessert. During Carnival, the Apfelk\u00fcchle is a must. It is also part of every religious holiday in southern Germany.\n\nPreparation\nMain ingredients\nThere are a few different ways to make Apfelk\u00fcchle. Most recipes differ mainly in minor ingredients, which are swapped out based on personal taste. Apfelk\u00fcchle all have a main ingredient of apples and dough (made from eggs, flour, sugar, salt, and milk). Different variations of dough can be made by adding extras such as beer, fruit brandy, and cinnamon.\n\nConsumption\nSince the end of the 18th century, it has become common to use a variety of sauces to refine dishes in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. As a popular dish in that area, Apfelk\u00fcchle is often served with its own variety of sauces and sides. The most common way to eat Apfelk\u00fcchle is warm with cinnamon and sugar, or dusted with powdered sugar. One of the most popular refinements is to serve it cold with a vanilla sauce. It is also popular, especially among children, to serve Apfelk\u00fcchle with vanilla ice cream. Cooks in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also like to flamb\u00e9 it with Grand Marnier or rum and serve it with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Another sauce used to dress Apfelk\u00fcchle is Chaudeausauce, a French term for hot water, which is composed mainly of wine, vinegar, lemon juice, egg yolks and sugar. It is traditionally made with white wine; usually champagne, and occasionally with a shot of cognac or sherry. It can be enjoyed both hot and cold.\n\nSee also\nList of pastries\nApple dumplings\nGerman baked apples\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRecipe for Apfelk\u00fcchle with vanilla sauce", "pages": ["Apple", "Apple dumplings", "Apple fritter", "Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg", "Batter (cooking)", "Beer", "Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria", "Champagne", "Chaudeausauce", "Chicken egg", "Cinnamon", "Cognac", "Dessert", "Diminutive", "Dough", "Egg yolks", "Fat Thursday", "Fat tuesday", "Flamb\u00e9", "Flour", "Fruit brandy", "German baked apples", "Germany", "Grand Marnier", "Holiday", "Ice cream", "Lemon juice", "List of pastries", "Milk", "Paczki", "Pancake", "Pastry", "Powdered sugar", "Rose Monday", "Rum", "Salt", "Sherry", "Sugar", "Swabian German", "Vanilla sauce", "Vinegar", "Wine"]}, "Category:Articles with topics of unclear notability from January 2022": {"body": "Beji (Berji, Pashi, or Barsaq, Persian: \u0628\u062c\u06cc) is a traditional Kurdish sweet that is mostly prepared in Kermanshah, Ilam, and Kurdistan.

It is served at restaurants and food trucks throughout Arkansas. The dish is also served in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. They are considered to be a delicacy of southern cuisine. Buffalo fish are sometimes looked down upon because of their boniness and their reputation as bottom feeders. They have historically been more widely eaten by minority groups such as African-Americans, and are considered soul food. Southern Living included Lassis' buffalo ribs on its list of \"The South's Best Soul Food\". In the 21st century, the popularity of buffalo ribs has declined to modernizing diet patterns.\n\nDescription\nBigmouth buffalo fish have gamey white meat with a flaky texture that is streaked with fat. With the exception of the meat around its ribs near the head, the fish's flesh contains small, free-floating bones. The ribs, along with the boneless meat surrounding them, are typically removed as fillets or \"slabs\". The ribs are prepared by breading them in an egg and cornmeal mixture, before deep-frying them in a manner similar to catfish.

Though they are sometimes said to have been invented by the Arby\u2019s restaurant chain, their actual origins are more complex.\n\nOrigins\nThe creation date of the curly fry has yet to be pinpointed, but its existence can be traced back to the 19th century. Oklahoma City's Dolores Restaurant and Inn served curly fries as \"Suzi-Q potatoes\" in 1938.\nIn the 1980s, Washington company TaterBoy had the debut of the industrial \"Curley Fries\". The first company to produce curly fries in mass quantities is Simplot, which used the specific blend of spices that became popular. Arby's is well known for curly fries, but they did not introduce them until 1988. However, Arby's may have been the first company to utilize Cajun-style seasoning on their \"Curly-Q Fries\".\n\nPreparation\nConAgra Foods, the company which produces Arby's curly fries, uses powerful industrial machinery such as spiralisers to turn whole potatoes into the curly fry shape. The curly fry shape can also be produced with spiral scissors.  For the spiralisers, the potatoes are cleaned, then are propelled through a set of pipes at 60 miles per hour by water. In the pipes, the potatoes are held in place and sliced by rotating blades, producing a spiral that has been found to go over two and a half feet long when stretched out.\nThe fries are then blanched, dried, battered with a mixture with the seasoning inside, fried, frozen, and refried at the restaurant.\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Ajiaco", "Aligot", "Aloo chaat", "Aloo gobi", "Aloo gosht", "Aloo pie", "Aloo tikki", "Arby's", "Arby\u2019s", "Baeckeoffe", "Baked potato", "Bangers and mash", "Batata harra", "Batata vada", "Black pepper", "Blanching (cooking)", "Bonda (snack)", "Boxty", "Brandade", "Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky", "Br\u00e6ndende k\u00e6rlighed", "Bubble and squeak", "Burrito", "Cajun cuisine", "Carapulcra", "Carne asada fries", "Cepelinai", "Champ (food)", "Cheese fries", "Chip butty", "Chorrillana", "Chu\u00f1o", "Clapshot", "Coddle", "Colcannon", "ConAgra Foods", "Crisp sandwich", "Croquette", "Cuisine of the United States", "Duchess potatoes", "Fondant potatoes", "French fries", "French tacos", "Fried potatoes", "Fritter", "Funeral potatoes", "Gamja-jeon", "Gamja-ongsimi", "Gamja-tang", "Garlic powder", "German fries", "Gnocchi", "Gratin", "Gratin dauphinois", "Halal snack pack", "Hash browns", "Hasselback potatoes", "Himmel und Erde", "Home fries", "Homity pie", "Hutspot", "Imelletty perunalaatikko", "Jansson's temptation", "Kapsalon", "Kartoffelk\u00e4se", "Knish", "Kouign patatez", "Kripik", "Kroppkaka", "Kugelis", "Lancashire hotpot", "Latke", "Lefse", "List of cuisines", "List of potato dishes", "Llapingacho", "Lobscouse", "Lomo saltado", "Lyonnaise potatoes", "Maluns", "Mashed potato", "Mince and tatties", "Mitraillette", "Munini-imo", "Nikujaga", "Ocopa", "Oklahoma City", "Olivier salad", "Onion powder", "Panackelty", "Papa a la Huanca\u00edna", "Papa rellena", "Papas arrugadas", "Papas chorreadas", "Papet Vaudois", "Paprika", "Patatas bravas", "Patatnik", "Perkedel", "Pitepalt", "Pommes Anna", "Pommes boulang\u00e8re", "Pommes dauphine", "Pommes souffl\u00e9es", "Potato babka", "Potato bread", "Potato cake", "Potato chip", "Potato doughnut", "Potato kugel", "Potato pancake", "Potato salad", "Potato scone", "Potato skins", "Potato waffle", "Potato wedges", "Potatoes", "Potatoes O'Brien", "Potatonik", "Poutine", "Poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e", "Pyttipanna", "P\u00e2t\u00e9 aux pommes de terre", "P\u00e9la (dish)", "Raclette", "Ragda pattice", "Rappie pie", "Raspeball", "Reibekuchen", "Rewena bread", "Rumbledethumps", "R\u00f6sti", "Salchipapa", "Salt potatoes", "Samosa", "Sayur sop", "Selat solo", "Shepherd's pie", "Simplot", "Skomakarl\u00e5da", "Spanish omelette", "Spice bag", "Stamppot", "Stoemp", "Stovies", "Sza\u0142ot", "Szilv\u00e1sgomb\u00f3c", "Tartiflette", "Tater tots", "Tombet", "Tornado potato", "Trinxat", "Triple-cooked chips", "Truffade", "Vada (food)", "Vada pav", "Washington (state)", "Wrap roti", "Yapchik", "\u00c4lplermagronen", "Wikipedia:Categorization", "Wikipedia:FAQ/Categorization", "Template:Potato dishes", "Template talk:Potato dishes", "Category:Articles needing additional categories from July 2023"]}, "The Times of India": {"body": "Dhooska or Dhuska is a popular deep-fried snack eaten all over Jharkhand and Bihar, India.

They became known as a food of the Southern United States after they were featured in the film Fried Green Tomatoes.\n\nTraditional preparation\nTraditional preparation of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices.  They are then seasoned with salt and pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat for a few minutes each side, or until golden brown.  Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato.\nAlternatives include using breadcrumbs or flour instead of cornmeal and frying in vegetable oil or other fat.\nThe sliced tomatoes may be dipped in a liquid before the cornmeal is added.  This liquid is usually buttermilk or beaten egg; egg results in a slightly firmer texture than buttermilk.  Liquids are used because cornmeal does not readily stick to tomato slices. Adding the liquid helps the cornmeal stay in place during the cooking process.  It also results in the coating on the tomato becoming thicker and less crunchy when compared to tomatoes cooked without a liquid wash.\n\nDistribution of the dish and popularity from the film\nHistorian Robert F. Moss found that from 1900-1911, there were 11 recipes for the dish published in U.S. newspapers. The articles were from the Northeastern United States and Midwestern United States. Moss believes that the dish originated from those areas, \"perhaps with a link to Jewish immigrants\".According to Moss, instructors in cooking in home economics courses adopted the dish. The sole instance of the recipe in the 1920s in the southern United States' newspapers came from an article that was in syndication across the United States, instead of being specifically from the South. From the 1930s to the 1960s, there was one instance of the recipe in Southern American newspapers. After the film Fried Green Tomatoes was released, Americans associated the dish with the South despite the lack of evidence that the dish was previously widely prepared in the U.S. South.As of 2017, within West Virginia, the dish is more often found in the southern portion of the state.\n\nPennsylvania Dutch version\nWhile fried green tomatoes are usually considered a southern dish they can be found in northern Pennsylvania Dutch homes as well. The northern version is more likely to be made with white flour rather than corn meal. Also, green tomatoes tend to be prepared at the end of the season in the north when the remaining fruit is harvested before the first frosts, whereas green tomatoes are picked throughout the season in the south.\n\nOther preparations\nFried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade is a southern and Creole combination served at many restaurants in New Orleans, Louisiana.While fried green tomatoes have traditionally been a side dish, they are sometimes used in main dishes:\n\nFried Green Tomato Po'Boy\nFried Green Tomato Parmesan\nFried Green Tomato Benedict\n\nSee also\nCuisine of the Southern United States\nList of tomato dishes\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==", "pages": ["Aculops lycopersici", "Adoration tomato", "Alicante tomato", "Amish Paste", "Arkansas Traveler tomato", "Aunt Ruby's German Green", "Azoychka", "Bacon", "Beefsteak tomato", "Better Boy", "Big Rainbow", "Blaby Special", "Black Krim", "Blue tomato", "Brandywine (tomato)", "Breadcrumbs", "British Tomato Growers' Association", "Bruschetta", "Buttermilk", "California", "Campari tomato", "Canned tomato", "Caprese salad", "Capuliato", "Celebrity tomato", "Charleston, West Virginia", "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "Cherokee purple", "Cherry tomato", "Cornmeal", "Cuisine of the Southern United States", "Curly top", "Disneyland Resort", "Early Girl", "Egg (food)", "Fat", "Fattoush", "Flavr Savr", "Flour", "Fourth of July tomato", "Fried Green Tomatoes", "Fried green tomatoes (disambiguation)", "Fusarium", "Galayet bandora", "Garden Peach", "Gazpacho", "Genetically modified tomato", "Grape tomato", "Green Zebra", "Hanover tomato", "Helicoverpa zea", "Hillbilly tomato", "Hungry Bear Restaurant", "Italian tomato pie", "Jersey Boy tomato", "Jubilee tomato", "Ketchup", "Kumato", "La Tomatina", "Lillian's Yellow", "List of tomato cultivars", "List of tomato diseases", "List of tomato dishes", "Manduca quinquemaculata", "Marglobe", "Matt's Wild Cherry", "Midwestern United States", "Mortgage Lifter", "Mr. Stripey", "Museum of Tomato", "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Nix v.

Consisting mainly of minced pork, it typically includes ingredients such as dried squid (\u571f\u9b77) and preserved cabbage (\u6885\u83dc). The dish is cooked by steaming over a pot of boiling water until it is well cooked. The seasonings usually include soy sauce, salt, sugar and corn flour and occasionally white pepper and sesame oil. It is usually served with rice during lunch or dinner.\n\nCulinary history\nThe origin of steam minced pork remains unknown. However, it is believed that it is originated from the Guangdong area of China and is classified as one of the representative Cantonese cuisine dishes. It consists of many typical Guangdong dishes qualities such as a sweet and salty flavour and the steaming method. It is believed to be stemmed from the Hakka (\u5ba2\u5bb6) culinary culture. Hakka traditional preserved food such as fermented vegetables like preserved cabbage (\u6885\u83dc), dried seafood like dried squid (\u571f\u9b77) are common components found in steam minced pork varieties to increase its flavour.  As it has widely spread around China, its flavour differentiates in different areas (e.g. less salty and more sweet in the Foshan area) and was mixed with different Southern China crops such as water chestnut and Chinese fermented black beans (\u8c46\u9f13), dried scallops creating different varieties.\n\nCharacteristic\nA characteristic of this homemade dish is the rhythmic pounding of the cleaver against the chopping board during preparing the hand-minced pork. Steam minced pork is popular and common among cantonese families because cantonese people find it goes well with rice, and the preparation and ingredients are also simple. For this reason, it is familiar to hear this hand-mincing sound from each home during lunch or dinner time in Hong Kong.\n\nVariation\nSteam minced pork can be divided into two types. One is a mixture of grind pork with other ingredient, this includes:\n\nSteam minced pork with shiitake mushrooms and dried scallops (\u51ac\u83c7\u7464\u67f1)\nSteam minced pork with dried squid (\u571f\u9b77)\nSteamed minced pork with preserved cabbage (\u6885\u83dc, \u201cmoi choi\u201d in Cantonese)Another type is steam minced pork with some additions, usually intensely savory and flavorful food placed on the patties, because Cantonese thinks it can \"lift\" up the pork. Examples are:\n\nSteamed minced pork with salted fish (\u9e79\u9b5a\u84b8\u8089\u9905)\nSteamed minced pork with salted egg (\u9e79\u86cb\u84b8\u8089\u9905)\n\nCooking method\nPreparation\nThe preparation usually starts with mincing the pork, traditionally by hand. A technique for yielding a denser and chewier meat texture is lifting the minced pork and thrusting it back into the bowl. The meat typically contains fatback and lean meat in a 1:2 ratio. Fatback is added to keep the moisture of the pork. However, this ratio depends on individual preferences. Seasoning such as soy sauce and other ingredients are added to the minced meat and mixed thoroughly by hand or using chopsticks.\nThere is no standard recipe: a variety of ingredients can be added for different flavors. Salted fish, Chinese water chestnut, and mushrooms are common additions.\n\nSteaming\nTraditionally, steamed minced pork is cooked by steaming. It is put on top of the steaming stand over a pot of boiling water. However, in Guangdong area, it is also steamed in rice cookers during rice cooking process. The cooking time usually last for 10 to 30 minutes until it is fully cooked.\n\nNutritional value\nResearch done by Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (2006) said that steamed minced pork and dried squid with rice contains 210 kilo-calorie, 22 g of carbohydrate, 7.7 g of protein, 9.6 g of total fat, 21 mg of cholesterol, 4 g of sugar and 8.4 mg of calcium, in each 100 g.

Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former is the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki).\nToday, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream sauce-tteokbokki, jajang-tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, rose-tteokbokki, galbi-tteokbokki and so on. Tteokbokki is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha (street stalls). There are also dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki (impromptu tteokbokki). It is also a popular home dish, as the rice cakes (garae-tteok) can be purchased in pre-packaged, semi-dehydrated form.\n\nHistory\nThe first record on tteok-bokki appears in Siuijeonseo, a 19th-century cookbook, where the dish was listed using the archaic spelling steokbokgi (\u112f\u1165\u11a8\ubcf5\uae30). According to the book, tteok-bokki was known by various names including tteokjjim (steamed rice cakes), tteok-japchae (stir-fried rice cakes), and tteok-jeongol (rice cakes hot pot). The royal court version was made from white tteok (rice cakes), sirloin, sesame oil, soy sauce, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds, while the savory, soy sauce-based tteok-bokki was made in the head house of the Papyeong Yun clan, where high-quality soy sauce was brewed. In this version, ingredients such as short ribs were common. The name tteok-bokki also appears in the revised and enlarged edition of Joseon Yori Jebeop, where it is described as a soy sauce-based savory dish.It is believed that the spicy variant of tteok-bokki made with gochujang-based sauce first appeared in 1953. When Ma Bok-Lim participated in the opening of a Korean-Chinese restaurant, she accidentally dropped tteok, or rice cake, that was handed during the opening into jajangmyeon. Realizing that it tasted good, she developed the idea of seasoning tteok in the Korean chili sauce, gochujang. After that, she began selling it in Sindang, which now has since become the most common variant of tteok-bokki. Consequently, the district of Sindang is now famously known for tteok-boki.\nToday, the typical tteok-bokki purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) and pojangmacha (street stalls) are red and spicy, while the soy sauce-based, non-spicy version is referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (\uad81\uc911\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"royal court tteok-bokki\"). Rice tteok rose in popularity as the South Korean economy developed, and various versions of the dish have proliferated since.  As it was once a working-class dish, wheat tteok was often substituted for rice tteok.\n\nVarieties\nLike other popular Korean dishes, tteok-bokki has seen numerous variations and fusions. Boiled eggs and pan-fried mandu (dumplings) were traditionally added to tteok-bokki. Ingredients such as seafood, short ribs, instant noodles, chewy noodles are also common additions to the dish.\n\nVariations based on added ingredients\nHaemul-tteok-bokki, (\ud574\ubb3c\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"seafood tteok-bokki\") features seafood as its secondary ingredient.\nGalbi-tteok-bokki (\uac08\ube44\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"short rib tteok-bokki\") features short ribs as its secondary ingredient.\nRa-bokki (\ub77c\ubcf6\uc774; \"instant noodle tteok-bokki\") and jol-bokki (\ucac4\ubcf6\uc774; \"chewy noodle tteok-bokki\") are similar variants which add noodles to tteok-bokki. Ra-bokki adds ramyeon (ramen) noodles, and jjol-bokki adds chewy jjolmyeon wheat noodles.\n\nJeukseok-tteok-bokki\nJeongol (hot pot)-type tteok-bokki is called jeukseok-tteok-bokki (\uc989\uc11d\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"on-the-spot tteok-bokki\"), and is boiled on a table-top stove during the meal. A variety of additions, such as vegetables, mandu (dumplings), and ramyeon or udong noodles are available at jeukseok-tteok-bokki restaurants. As jeukseok-tteok-bokki is usually a meal rather than a snack, it is often paired with bokkeum-bap (fried rice).\n\nVariation based on sauce\nGochujang tteokbokki\nPiquant, red gochujang-based tteok-bokki is one of Korea's most popular snacks. While both soup-style gungmul-tteok-bokki (\uad6d\ubb3c\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"soup tteok-bokki\") and dry gireum-tteok-bokki (\uae30\ub984\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"oil tteok-bokki\") are commonly enjoyed, the former is considered the de facto standard style. In gungmul-tteok-bokki, kelp-anchovy stock is often used to bring out the savory flavor. Gochugaru (chili powder) is often added for additional heat and color, while mullyeot (rice syrup) helps with sweetness and consistency. Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and diagonally sliced scallions are common additions to the dish. In gireum-tteok-bokki, the mixture of gochugaru (\uace0\ucda7\uac00\ub8e8; \"Korean chili powder\"), soy sauce, sugar or syrup, and sesame oil often replaces gochujang (chili paste). Soft tteok sticks are seasoned with the sauce mixture, then stir-fried in cooking oil with a handful of chopped scallions and served. Tongin Market in Jongno, Seoul is famous for its gireum-tteok-bokki.\nThere are also many variations in gochujang tteok-bokki, such as a version that is seasoned with perilla leaf.\n\nGunjung tteokbokki\nSweet and savory, brown soy sauce-based tteok-bokki is often referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (\uad81\uc911\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"royal court tteok-bokki\"). Its history dates back to a royal court dish before the introduction of chili pepper to the Korean peninsula in the mid-Joseon era (17th & 18th centuries). The earliest record of gungjung tteok-bokki is found in an 1800s cookbook called Siuijeonseo. Having a taste similar to japchae (stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables), it was enjoyed by the royals as a banchan and as a snack. Although traditional tteok-bokki was made with soup soy sauce, which is the traditional (and at the time, the only) type of soy sauce in pre-modern Korea, sweeter regular soy sauce has taken its place in modern times. Other traditional ingredients such as sirloin or short ribs, sesame oil, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds are still commonly used in modern gungjung-tteok-bokki. Other ingredients such as mung bean sprouts, carrots, onions, dried Korean zucchini, garlic, and shiitake mushrooms are also common. The dish is typically served with egg garnish.\n\nOther variations\nGungmul (soup) tteok-bokki that are not based on either soy sauce or gochujang have also gained in popularity. There are some well-known variations.\nCurry tteok-bokki uses a yellow Korean-style curry base.\nCream sauce tteok-bokki uses a base inspired by carbonara. Cream sauce and bacon are used instead of gochujang and fish cakes.Rose tteok-bokki  named after rose pasta, as a variation. For this tteok-bokki, cream sauce is added to the basic tteok-bokki.\nMala tteok-bokki is a fusion tteok-bokki dish that uses a base inspired by Chinese malatang. This variation may include mala sauce, wide glass noodles, and bok choy in addition to traditional tteok-bokki ingredients.\nJajang-tteok-bokki features a sauce based on jajang (sweet bean paste).\nCheese tteok-bokki is a variant in which the tteok-bokki is either topped or stuffed with cheese. It is sold in snack bars and can also easily be made at home. Depending on personal preference, it can be eaten with seasonings such as green tea powder, herb powder, sesame, or parsley.\nOutside of Korea, Shanghainese ch\u01ceo ni\u00e1ng\u0101o (\u7092\u5e74\u7cd5) is a stir-fried dish made with tteok-like rice cakes sliced into flat oval shapes, scallions, beef, pork and cabbage.\n\nGireum and gyeran tteok-bokki\nGireum tteok-bokki (\uae30\ub984\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"oil tteok-bokki\") is a variety of tteok-bokki that is stir-fried in oil and served with little or no sauce.\nGyeran tteok-bokki (\uacc4\ub780\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"egg tteok-bokki\") is another variation that features no sauce. Only tteok (rice cakes), eggs, vegetables, and seasonings (primarily salt) are used. It differs from gireum tteok-bokki in that it is not spicy.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nBunsik\nGimbap\nKorean cuisine\nKorean royal court cuisine\nRice cake\nSundae\nDeep frying\nNian gao\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Dongdaemoon Yeopgi Tteokbokki\nOfficial website of Sinjeon Tteokbokki\nOfficial website of BaeDDuck", "pages": ["Banchan", "Bokkeum", "Bokkeum-bap", "Bunsik", "Carbonara", "Chili pepper", "Chili powder", "Curry", "Deep frying", "Doopedia", "Doosan Corporation", "Dumpling", "Egg garnish", "Engraulis japonicus", "Eomuk", "Fishcake", "Galbi", "Ganjang", "Garae-tteok", "Gimbap", "Gochugaru", "Gochujang", "Guk", "Hangul", "Jajangmyeon", "Japchae", "Jeongol", "Jjim", "Jjolmyeon", "Jongno", "Joseon era", "Korea", "Korean Food Foundation", "Korean cuisine", "Korean language", "Korean royal court cuisine", "Korean zucchini", "List of cuisines", "Malatang", "Mandu (dumpling)", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Mullyeot", "Mung bean sprout", "National Institute of Korean Language", "Nian gao", "Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o", "Perilla leaf", "Pine nut", "Pojangmacha", "Ra-bokki", "Rabokki", "Ramyeon", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Rice cake", "Saccharina japonica", "Sauce", "Scallion", "Seafood", "Seoul", "Sesame oil", "Shanghai cuisine", "Shiitake", "Short ribs", "Sindang-dong", "Sirloin steak", "Siuijeonseo", "Soup soy sauce", "South Korea", "Sugar", "Sundae (Korean food)", "Sweet bean sauce", "Tianmian sauce", "Tongin Market", "Tteok", "Udon", "Umbilicaria esculenta", "Yoon (Korean surname)", "Wikipedia:Link rot", "Wikipedia:NOTRS", "Wikipedia:Please clarify", "Template:Cite book", "Help:IPA/Korean", "Category:Articles lacking reliable references from October 2021", "Category:Articles with dead external links from April 2022", "Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher", "Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification from April 2020"]}, "Fried chicken": {"body": "", "pages": ["Fried chicken"]}, "Category:Fried noodles": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Fried pork": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Fried vegetables": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Syrup": {"body": "", "pages": ["Pancake", "Help:Categories", "Category:Syrup"]}, "Category:Food paste": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from November 2018": {"body": "Bi\u0142goraj pier\u00f3g (Polish: Pier\u00f3g bi\u0142gorajski, pir\u00f3g bi\u0142gorajski, krupniak) is a traditional Polish regional dish, originating from Bi\u0142goraj Land, formerly prepared for important celebrations and holidays.Pier\u00f3g bi\u0142gorajski is baked either without a crust - then it's called \"bald\" (pol. \u0142ysy) - or with a yeast dough crust.

Originally a traditional condiment from the J\u014detsu region, the name \"kanzuri\" was trademarked in 1966 by the Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. of My\u014dk\u014d, the sole maker of the product.\n\nDescription\nKanzuri is a chili paste with a bright red color. Its texture and flavor are similar to that of yuzu kosh\u014d, which is prepared with the identical principal ingredients, but kanzuri has a milder flavor that is sweeter and less salty. The flavor of kanzuri is also comparable to that of Tabasco sauce or doubanjiang.\n\nProduction\nThe process to make kanzuri typically takes approximately three to four years. The ingredients used are t\u014dgarashi, yuzu, salt, and k\u014dji mold.Production begins in April of the first year with the planting of the t\u014dgarashi used for kanzuri. The particular cultivar used for the making of kanzuri is known as S-30; it is locally grown and about three times larger than other t\u014dgarashi. These S-30 t\u014dgarashi are harvested in the summer. The crop is rinsed with sea water, ground with yuzu and k\u014dji mold, then left to ferment in barrels. In June or July, prior to the onset of peak summer heat, the barrels of fermenting t\u014dgarashi are exposed to the air. This takes place from August until November. During the coldest part of the year, typically around January 20, the t\u014dgarashi are then laid out on snow to dry for several days in a traditional process known as kanzarashi or yukisarashi (Japanese: \u96ea\u3055\u3089\u3057). This is repeated several times until March. Exposure to the snow increases the potency of the t\u014dgarashi's flavor and removes excess salt and bitterness. This process is repeated each year, after which the kanzuri is bottled and shipped to market.Different varieties of kanzuri may take longer to ferment, with one variety taking as long as six years.Kanzuri was trademarked by Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. of My\u014dk\u014d, Niigata in 1966, who later also trademarked the name in China, South Korea, and the United States. They are the exclusive makers of kanzuri.\n\nUses\nTraditionally, people from the J\u014detsu region, which is known in Japan for its heavy snowfall, used kanzuri as a condiment that was thought to help warm up body temperature.Today, kanzuri is used in a wide variety of dishes, including ramen, miso soup, yakiniku, nabemono, natt\u014d, and pasta. It can also be dissolved into wasabi or tare, as well as be eaten as a complement to tsukemono. It is also used as a seasoning in snacks including kaki no tane, senbei, Kappa Ebisen, instant yakisoba, ramen, and chorizo.According to T\u014dj\u014d Kuniaki, the current president of Kanzuri, Co. Ltd., restaurateurs and chefs in Japan often use kanzuri as a \"great supporting actor\" and \"secret ingredient\" in their dishes. They have reported to him that kanzuri helps to mitigate the oiliness of a dish or to brighten its flavor.\n\nHistory\nLocal legend in J\u014detsu ascribes the origin of kanzuri to Uesugi Kenshin, who is said to have introduced t\u014dgarashi to the region from Kyoto. Kanzuri was originally made by grinding t\u014dgarashi together with miso paste.The modern manufacturing of kanzuri began after the Pacific War. At the time, traditional food culture was rapidly disappearing in Japan, which during its postwar economic surge became Westernized. T\u014dj\u014d Kuniji, the founder of what later became the official maker of kanzuri, deplored the situation, and told his son that he had to protect the heritage of kanzuri. He began to research methods of making kanzuri and sought to replicate homemade kanzuri for the domestic market. After graduating high school, his son Kuniaki joined him in his efforts.A breakthrough came when Kuniaki was sent to the United States as part of an agricultural study-abroad program for his university. As he and his fellow students dined on steak on one occasion, he procured a jar of kanzuri that he had brought with him from home. He invited others to try it and their positive reaction strengthened his resolve to popularize kanzuri. When he returned, he co-founded Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. in My\u014dk\u014d with his father and trademarked the name \"kanzuri\".Local elderly women were recruited to help with the manufacturing of kanzuri and produce the right flavor. At first, he sold his kanzuri door-to-door to neighbors. Although his efforts were derided at the time, kanzuri became popular and the company a success. It currently makes approximately 20 tons of kanzuri per year.Both kanzuri and the process of yukisarashi have become popular tourist attractions in My\u014dk\u014d.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nVideo about the making and uses of kanzuri", "pages": ["Agedashi d\u014dfu", "Agemochi", "Ajika", "Ajilim\u00f3jili", "Ajvar", "Aj\u00ed (sauce)", "Amanatt\u014d", "Amazake", "Anpan", "Aquarius (beverage)", "Arare (food)", "Arctium", "Ashley Food Company", "Aspergillus oryzae", "Awamori", "Bajan pepper sauce", "Bamboo shoot", "Bancha", "Barley tea", "Beni sh\u014dga", "Bento", "Blair's Sauces and Snacks", "Boss Coffee", "Botan Rice Candy", "Bread crumbs", "Buffalo sauce", "C.C.

considered one of Cambodia's national dishes. Fish amok is believed to have been a royal Khmer dish dating back to the Khmer Empire, although some question it originating in Cambodia.\n\nIngredients\nUsually, goby, snakehead or catfish is used; however, they are also sometimes substituted with cod, snapper, barramundi, salmon, whiting, or perch. The fish fillets are rubbed with or marinated in a freshly-made yellow or green kroeung mixed with coconut cream or coconut milk and eggs. The curry mixture is placed in a banana leaf container with great morinda leaves at the bottom and steamed for around 20 to 30 minutes until the curry achieves a mousse-like consistency. Great morinda leaves can also be substituted with Swiss chard leaves if not available.Fish amok is served hot usually in either banana leaf containers or coconut shells and eaten with steamed rice.\nMany restaurants in Cambodia also serve less traditional versions of amok with chicken, tofu, or beef instead of fish. Other deviations include the use of a store-bought herb paste, other types of kroeung, more liquid consistency and cooking instead of steaming.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nAmok Trei/Fish Amok. 1 May 2021.

It is traditionally considered a luxurious ingredient.\n\nProduction\nThe process for making the paste is similar to that used to make smooth red bean paste. First, the dried seeds are stewed in water until soft and then mashed into a fine paste. The paste is then watered down to a thin slurry and passed through a sieve and into cheesecloth, with which it is squeezed dry. This produces a fine crumbly paste, which is then mixed with sugar or other sweeteners and often oil to produce a smooth, sweet paste.\n\nUse\nChina\nThe lotus paste used by most Chinese cooks requires further preparation by dry cooking the sweetened paste over heat with caramelized sugar and vegetable oil. This produces a lotus paste that is tan coloured with a satiny sheen, which is rich, sweet, and silky with a slight fragrance of caramel. Some cooks choose to treat the dried lotus seeds with a lye solution before initially stewing them in order to shorten their cooking time.Lotus paste is used in Chinese cuisine as a filling for mooncake, baozi, and other sweet pastries. Another common use of lotus paste is as a filling for lotus seed buns, a dim sum item.Due to the higher price of lotus seeds, commercially prepared lotus pastes may also contain white kidney bean paste as a filler. There are different variations with some darker, close to black in color.  Usually these have a deeper taste.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nSweet bean paste", "pages": ["Baozi", "Caramel", "Cheesecloth", "Common bean", "Cooking", "Dim sum", "Jyutping", "Lotus seed", "Lotus seed bun", "Lye", "Mooncake", "Red bean paste", "Salted duck egg", "Simplified Chinese characters", "Slurry", "Sweet bean paste", "Traditional Chinese characters", "Wayback Machine", "Yale romanization of Cantonese", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Help:IPA/Cantonese", "Help:IPA/Mandarin", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from August 2021", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from March 2014"]}, "Portal:New Zealand": {"body": "Marmite ( MAR-myte) is a food spread produced in New Zealand by Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company and distributed in Australia and the Pacific. Marmite is made from yeast extract, a by-product of beer brewing. It is similar to the British Marmite, but the two products are made by different companies (the UK version is made by Unilever). \nMarmite has been manufactured in New Zealand since 1919. It is the only product sold as Marmite in Australasia and the Pacific Islands, whereas elsewhere in the world the British version predominates.\n\nHistory\nIn the late 19th century  German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled, and eaten. In 1902 the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England with Marmite as its main product and Burton as the site of the first factory.The product's popularity prompted the Sanitarium Health Food Company to obtain sole rights to distribute the product in New Zealand and Australia in 1908. They later began manufacturing Marmite under licence in Christchurch, albeit using a modified version of the original recipe, most notable for its inclusion of sugar and caramel. Common ingredients are also slightly different quantities from the British version; the New Zealand version has high levels of potassium, for example. New Zealand Marmite is described as having a \"weaker\" or \"less tangy\" flavour than the British version. It is distributed throughout Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\n\nUsage\nSanitarium recommends spreading Marmite on bread with potato chips added to make a \"Marmite and Chippie\" sandwich.\n\nNutritional information\nMarmite is rich in B vitamins including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), folic acid (B9) and vitamin B12. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid.\n\nAvailability worldwide\nAs Unilever has the exclusive right to the Marmite name in the United Kingdom, and Sanitarium has the exclusive right to the name in Australia and New Zealand, their respective versions of Marmite must be sold under a different name in the other countries. Unilever International sells the British Marmite as Our Mate in Australia and New Zealand, while Sanitarium sells the New Zealand Marmite as \"NZ-Mite\" in the UK.\nIn November 2008, Marmite was rebranded as 'Mo-mite' in support of Movember, the annual moustache-growing charity event.\n\n2012\u201313 \"Marmageddon\" shortage\nIn November 2011, Sanitarium shut down the sole production line of New Zealand Marmite at its Christchurch factory after a cooling tower at the factory was deemed unsafe, having cracked in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and its aftershocks. On 19 March 2012, the company announced that its own stocks of Marmite had run out and the production line was not expected to be running again until July. Some supermarkets reported at the time they had already run out of stock, and there was only a few weeks' worth of stock left in their distribution centres, leading to the dubbing of Marmite as \"black gold\" and the crisis as \"Marmageddon\".Immediately after the announcement, there was reported panic buying of Marmite from supermarkets, and over one hundred auctions for jars of Marmite, new and used, were listed on online auction site TradeMe, with some sellers asking for up to NZ$800 per jar; over 185 times its usual retail price of around $4.25 per 250 g jar People were advised to use the spread sparingly, with even Prime Minister John Key admitting he might have to switch to Australian rival Vegemite once his personal supplies had run out. Throughout the shortage Marmite ran a number of marketing campaigns on social media which led to a 2,975% increase in fans and a lot of brand exposure.In June 2012, it was announced that additional structural damage had been uncovered at the factory, and the proposed July return to production was rescheduled to October. Problems with an unfinished lift at the factory delayed production into 2013.Sanitarium announced in February 2013 that production had restarted and the factory was in the process of building up stock ready for the return. Marmite returned to New Zealand retailers effective midnight on 20 March 2013, although only the 250 g jar size was initially available and many supermarkets imposed a limit of two jars per customer per day to promote fairness and prevent bulk buying. Supply to overseas retailers resumed after the New Zealand supply and demand settled.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website", "pages": ["2011 Christchurch earthquake", "Ambient food", "Australasia", "BBC News", "Brewing", "Burton upon Trent", "By-product", "Cenovis", "Christchurch", "Folic acid", "Glutamic acid", "Guinness Yeast Extract", "John Key", "Justus von Liebig", "List of spreads", "Marmite", "Movember", "Niacin (nutrient)", "Nutritional yeast", "Pacific Islands", "Panic buying", "Potassium", "Potato chip", "Promite", "Riboflavin", "Salt", "Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company", "Spread (food)", "Television New Zealand", "The Guardian", "The New Zealand Herald", "The Press", "Thiamin", "TradeMe", "Twiglets", "Unilever", "Vegemite", "Vitam-R", "Vitamin B12", "Yeast extract", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Help:IPA/English", "Help:Pronunciation respelling key", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from August 2021", "Portal:Food", "Portal:New Zealand"]}, "Category:CS1 maint: location missing publisher": {"body": "The mung bean (Vigna radiata), alternatively known as green gram, maash (Persian, Kurdish: \u0645\u0627\u0634), m\u016bng (Hindi: \u092e\u0942\u0902\u0917), m\u016b\u0303g (Bengali: \u09ae\u09c1\u0981\u0997), monggo, \u0111\u1eadu xanh (Vietnamese; literally, \"green bean\"), pesalu (Telugu: \u0c2a\u0c46\u0c38\u0c32\u0c41), kacang hijau (Indonesian and Malay; literally \"green bean\") or munggo (Philippines), is a plant species in the legume family. The mung bean is mainly cultivated in East, Southeast and South Asia. It is used as an ingredient in both savoury and sweet dishes.\n\nDescription\nThe green gram is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods.\nThe English word mung originated from the Hindi word m\u016b\u1e45g (\u092e\u0942\u0902\u0917), which is derived from the Sanskrit word mudga (\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0917).\n\nMorphology\nMung bean (Vigna radiata) is a plant species of Fabaceae and is also known as green gram. It is sometimes confused with black gram (Vigna mungo) for their similar morphology, though they are two different species. The green gram is an annual vine with yellow flowers and fuzzy brown pods. There are three subgroups of Vigna radiata, including one cultivated (Vigna radiata subsp. radiata) and two wild ones (Vigna radiata subsp. sublobata and Vigna radiata subsp. glabra). It has a height of about 15\u2013125 cm (5.9\u201349.2 in).Mung bean has a well-developed root system. The lateral roots are many and slender, with root nodules grown. Stems are much branched, sometimes twining at the tips. Young stems are purple or green, and mature stems are grayish-yellow or brown. They can be divided into erect cespitose, semi-trailing and trailing types. Wild types tend to be prostrate while cultivated types are more erect.Leaves are ovoid or broad-ovoid, cotyledons die after emergence, and ternate leaves are produced on two single leaves. The leaves are 6\u201312 cm long and 5\u201310 cm wide. Racemes with yellow flowers are borne in the axils and tips of the leaves, with 10\u201325 flowers per pedicel, self-pollinated. The fruits are elongated cylindrical or flat cylindrical pods, usually 30\u201350 per plant. The pods are 5\u201310 cm long and 0.4\u20130.6 cm wide and contain 12\u201314 septum-separated seeds, which can be either cylindrical or spherical in shape, and green, yellow, brown, or blue in color. Seed colors and presence or absence of a rough layer are used to distinguish different types of mung bean.\n\nGrowth stages\nGermination is typically within 4\u20135 days, but the actual rate varies according to the amount of moisture introduced during the germination stage. It is epigeal, with the stem and cotyledons emerging from the seedbed.After germination, the seed splits, and a soft, whitish root grows. Mung bean sprouts are harvested during this stage. If not harvested, it develops a root system, then a green stem which contains two leaves and shoots up from the soil. After that, seed pods begin to form on its branches, with 10\u201315 seeds contained in each pod.The maturation can take up to 60 days. Once matured, it can reach up to 30 inches (76 cm) tall, with multiple branches with seed pods. Most of the seed pods become darker, while some remain green.\n\nNitrogen fixation and cover crop\nAs a legume plant, mung bean is in symbiotic association with Rhizobia which enables it to fix atmospheric nitrogen (58\u2013109 kg per ha mung bean). It can provide large amounts of biomass (7.16 t biomass/ha) and nitrogen to the soil (ranging from 30 to 251 kg/ha). The nitrogen fixation ability not only enables it to meet its own nitrogen requirement, but also benefits the succeeding crops. It can be used as a cover crop before or after cereal crops in rotation, which makes a good green manure.\n\nTaxonomy\nMung beans are one of many species moved from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna in the 1970s. The previous names were Phaseolus aureus or P. radiatus.\n\nCultivation\nVarieties\nThe mung bean varieties now are mainly targeted in resistance to pests and diseases, particularly the bean weevil and mung bean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV). For now, the main varieties include Samrat, IPM2-3, SML 668 and Meha in India; Crystal, Jade-AU, Celera-AU\uff0cSatin II\uff0cRegur in Australia; Zhonglv No. 1, Zhonglv No. 2, Jilv No. 2, Jilv No. 7, Weilv No. 4, Jihong 9218, Jihong 8937, Bao 876-16, Bao 8824-17 in China. Also, with the help of the World Vegetable Center, the traits of mung bean have been considerably improved.'Summer Moong' is a short-duration mung bean pulse crop grown in northern India. Due to its short duration, it can fit well in-between of many cropping systems. It is mainly cultivated in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It is considered to be the hardiest of all pulse crops and requires a hot climate for germination and growth.\n\nClimate and soil requirements\nMung bean is a warm-season and frost-intolerant plant. Mung bean is suitable for being planted in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions. The most suitable temperature for mung bean's germination and growth is 15\u201318 \u00b0C (59\u201364 \u00b0F). Mung bean has high adaptability to various soil types, while the best pH of the soil is between 6.2 and 7.2. Mung bean is a short-day plant and long days will delay its flowering and podding.\n\nHarvest\nThe yield potential of mung bean is around 2.5 to 3.0 t/ha, however, usually due to the resistance to environmental stress and improper management, the average productivity for mung bean is only 0.5 t/ha. Due to the indeterminate flowering habit of mung bean, when facing proper environmental conditions, there can be both flowers and pods in one mung bean plant, which makes it difficult to harvest it. The perfect harvesting stage is when 90% of the pods' colour in one yield has been black. Mung beans can use a harvester for harvesting. It is important to set up the header in case of over-threshing.\n\nTransportation and storage condition\nThe perfect moisture of grain for transportation is 13%. Before storage, the cleaning and grading process must be done. The ideal storage condition should keep the mung bean's moisture at exactly 12%.\n\nPests, diseases and abiotic stress\nMost of the mung bean cultivars have a yield potential of 1.8\u20132.5 tons/ha. However, the actual average productivity of mung bean hovers around 0.5\u20130.7 t/ha. Several factors constrain its yield, including biotic stresses (pests and diseases) and abiotic stresses. Stresses not only decrease productivity but also affect the physical quality of seeds, making them unusable or unfit for human consumption. All the stresses collectively can lead to significant yield losses of up to 10\u2013100%.\n\nPests\nInsect pests attack mung bean at all crop stages from sowing to storage stage and take a heavy toll on crop yield. Some insect pests directly damage the crop, while others act as vectors of diseases to transmit the virus.\nStem fly (bean fly) is one of the major pests of mung bean. This pest infests the crop within a week after germination and under epidemic conditions, it can cause total crop loss.Whitefly, B. tabaci, is a serious pest in mung bean and damages the crop either directly by feeding on phloem sap and excreting honeydew on the plant that forms black sooty mould or indirectly by transmitting mung bean yellow mosaic disease (MYMD). Whitefly causes yield losses between 17% and 71% in mung bean.\nThrips infest mung bean both in the seedling and flowering stages. During the seedling stage, thrips infest the seedling's growing point when it emerges from the ground, and under severe infestation, the seedlings fail to grow. Flowering thrips cause heavy damage and attack during flowering and pod formation, which feed on the pedicles and stigma of flowers. Under severe infestation, flowers drop and no pod formation takes place.Spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is a major insect pest in mung bean in the tropics and subtropics. The pest causes a yield loss of 2\u201384% in mung bean amounting to US $30 million. The larvae damage all the stages of the crop including flowers, stems, peduncles, and pods; however, heavy damage occurs at the flowering stage where the larvae form webs combining flowers and leaves.\nCowpea aphid sucks plant sap that causes loss of plant vigor and may lead to yellowing, stunting or distortion of plant parts. Further, aphids secrete honeydew (unused sap) which leads to the development of sooty mould on plant parts. Cowpea aphid also can act as a vector of the mung bean common mosaic virus.\nBruchid is the most severe stored pest of legume seeds worldwide, with damage up to 100% losses within 3\u20136 months, if not controlled. Bruchid infestation in mungbean results in weight loss, low germination, and nutritional changes in seeds, thereby reducing the nutritional and market value, rendering it unfit for human consumption, and agricultural and commercial uses.\n\nDiseases\nMungbean yellow mosaic disease (MYMD) is a significant viral disease of mung bean, which causes severe yield losses annually. MYMD is caused by three distinct begomoviruses, transmitted by whitefly. The economic losses due to MYMD account for up to 85% yield reduction in India.The major fungal diseases are Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), dry root rot, powdery mildew and anthracnose. Dry root rot (Macrophomina phaseolina) is an emerging disease of mungbean, causing 10\u201344% yield losses in mung bean production in India and Pakistan. The pathogen affects the fibrovascular system of the roots and basal internodes of its host, impeding the transport of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant.Halo blight, bacterial leaf spot, and tan spot are significant bacterial diseases.\n\nAbiotic stress\nAbiotic stresses negatively influence plant growth and productivity and are the primary causes of extensive agricultural losses worldwide. Reduction in crop yield due to environmental variations has increased steadily over the decades.Salinity affects crop growth and yield by way of osmotic stress, ion toxicity, and reduced nodulation which ultimately lead to reduced nitrogen-fixing ability. Excessive salt leads to leaf injury and then reduced photosynthesis.High-temperature stress negatively affects reproductive development in mung bean and affects all reproductive traits like flower initiation, pollen viability, fertilization, pod set, seed quality, etc. High temperatures over 42 \u00b0C during summer causes hardening of seeds due to incomplete sink development.Mung bean requires a light moisture regime in the soil during its growing period, while at the time of harvest, complete dry conditions are required. Since it is mostly grown under rainfed conditions, it is more susceptible to water deficiencies as compared to many other food legumes. Drought affects its growth and development by negatively affecting vegetative growth, flower initiation, abnormal pollen behavior and pod set. However, simultaneously, excess moisture or waterlogging, even for a short period of time, especially at the early vegetative stage may be detrimental to the crop.Mung bean may also be affected by excess soil and atmospheric moisture during the rainy season which may lead to pre-harvest sprouting in mature pods. It deteriorates the quality of the seed/grain produced.\n\nIntegrated disease management\nUsing climate analysis tools delivered on the web can firstly help farmers interrogate climate records to ask questions relating to rainfall, temperature, radiation, and derived variables to avoid some of the abiotic stresses. Deployment of varieties with genetic resistance is the most effective and durable method for integrated disease management, in the meantime focusing on yield, height, grain quality, market opportunities and seed availability. For pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), the development of mung bean cultivars with a short (10\u201315 days) period of fresh seed dormancy (FSD) is important to curtail losses incurred by PHS.\n\nMarket\nMung bean plants have a long history of being consumed by humans. The main consumed parts are the seeds and sprouts. The mature seeds provide an invaluable source of digestible protein for humans in places where meat is lacking or where people are mostly vegetarian. Mung bean has a large market in Asia (India, Southeast Asia and East Asia) and is also consumed in Southern Europe and in the Southern US. Mung bean protein is considered safe as a novel food (NF) pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. The consumption of mung bean varies depending on the geographic region. For instance, in India, mung bean is used in sweets, snacks and savoury items. In other parts of Asia, it is used in cakes, sprouts, noodles and soups. In Europe and America, it is mainly used as fresh bean sprouts. The consumption of mung beans as such in the US is in the order of 22\u201329 g/capita per year, while the consumption in some areas of Asia can be as high as 2 kg/capita per year.Mung bean is considered an alternative crop in many regions, which is generally preferable to sign a contract for the growing process before planting. In the US, the average price of mung bean is around $0.20 per pound. This is double the price of soybeans. The difference in production costs for mung bean and soybean is due to post-harvest cleaning and/or transportation. Overall, mung bean is considered to have market potential for its drought tolerance, and it is a food crop and not a feed crop, which can help buffer the economic risk from variability in commodity crop prices for farmers.\n\nUses\nNutritional value\nMung beans are recognized for their high nutritive value. Mung beans contain about 55\u201365% carbohydrate (equal to 630 g/kg dry weight) and are rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is composed of about 20\u201350% protein of total dry weight, among which globulin (60%) and albumin (25%) are the primary storage proteins (see table). Mung bean is considered to be a substantive source of dietary proteins. The proteolytic cleavage of these proteins are even higher during sprouting. Mung bean carbohydrates are easily digestible, which causes less flatulence in humans compared to other forms of legumes. Both seeds and sprouts of mung bean produce lower calories compared to other cereals, which makes it more attractive to obese and diabetic individuals.\n\nCulinary\nWhole cooked mung beans are generally prepared from dried beans by boiling until they are soft. Mung beans are light yellow in colour when their skins are removed. Mung bean paste can be made by hulling, cooking, and pulverizing the beans to a dry paste.\n\nSouth Asia\nAlthough whole mung beans are also occasionally used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used. In Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans are commonly boiled to make a dry preparation often served with congee. Hulled mung beans can also be used in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups.\nIn Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, mung beans are partially mashed, fermented and made into fritters called mangode, which serves as a common tea time snack similar to Pakora.  \nIn Goa, sprouted mung beans are cooked in a coconut milk based, mild curry called moonga gaathi.\nMung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung dal. In Bangladesh and West Bengal the stripped and split bean is used to make a soup-like dal known as mug \u1e0dal (\u09ae\u09c1\u0997 \u09a1\u09be\u09b2).\nIn the South Indian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and also in Maharashtra, steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and fresh grated coconut. In South India, especially Andhra Pradesh, batter made from ground whole moong beans (including skin) is used to make a variety of dosa called pesarattu or pesara dosa.\n\nEast Asia\nIn southern Chinese cuisine, whole mung beans are used to make a t\u00e1ngshu\u01d0, or dessert, called l\u01dcd\u00f2u t\u00e1ngshu\u01d0, which is served either warm or chilled. They are also often cooked with rice to make congee. Unlike in South Asia, whole mung beans seldom appear in savory dishes.\nIn Hong Kong, hulled mung beans and mung bean paste are made into ice cream or frozen ice pops. Mung bean paste is used as a common filling for Chinese mooncakes in East China and Taiwan. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the boiled and shelled beans are used as filling in zongzi prepared for consumption. The beans may also be cooked until soft, blended into a liquid, sweetened, and served as a beverage, popular in many parts of China. In South China and Vietnam, mung bean paste may be mixed with sugar, fat, and fruits or spices to make pastries, such as b\u00e1nh \u0111\u1eadu xanh.\nIn Korea, skinned mung beans are soaked and ground with some water to make a thick batter. This is used as a basis for the Korean pancakes called bindae-tteok. They are also commonly used for Hobak-tteok.\n\nSoutheast Asia\nIn the Philippines, ginis\u00e1ng mongg\u00f3/m\u00f3nggo (saut\u00e9ed mung bean stew), also known as mongg\u00f3/m\u00f3nggo guisado or balatong, is a savoury stew of whole mung beans with prawns or fish. It is traditionally served on Fridays of Lent, when the majority of Catholic Filipinos traditionally abstain from meat. Variants of ginis\u00e1ng mongg\u00f3/m\u00f3nggo may also be made with chicken or pork. Mung beans are also used in the Filipino dessert ginataang munggo (also known as balatong), a rice gruel with coconut milk and sugar flavored with pandan leaves or vanilla.Mung bean paste is also a common filling of pastries known as ond\u00e9-ond\u00e9 and bakpia in Indonesia and hopia in the Philippines, and further afield in Guyana (where it is known as \"black eye cake\"). It is also used as a filling for pan de monggo, a Filipino bread. In Indonesia, mung beans are also made into a popular dessert snack called es kacang hijau, which has the consistency of a porridge. The beans are cooked with sugar, coconut milk, and a little ginger.\n\nMiddle East\nA staple diet in some parts of the Middle East is mung beans and rice. Both are cooked together in a pilaf-like rice dish called m\u0101\u0161 wa-ruzz, which means mung beans and rice.\n\nBean sprouts\nMung beans are germinated by leaving them in water for four hours of daytime light and spending the rest of the day in the dark. Mung bean sprouts can be grown under artificial light for four hours over the period of a week. They are usually simply called \"bean sprouts\". However, when bean sprouts are called for in recipes, it generally refers to mung bean or soybean sprouts.\nMung bean sprouts are stir-fried as a Chinese vegetable accompaniment to a meal, usually with garlic, ginger, spring onions, or pieces of salted dried fish to add flavour. Uncooked bean sprouts are used in filling for Vietnamese spring rolls, as well as a garnish for ph\u1edf. They are a major ingredient in a variety of Malaysian and Peranakan cuisine, including char kway teow, hokkien mee, mee rebus, and pasembor.\nIn Korea, slightly cooked mung bean sprouts, called sukjunamul (Korean: \uc219\uc8fc\ub098\ubb3c), are often served as a side dish. They are blanched (placed into boiling water for less than a minute), immediately cooled in cold water, and mixed with sesame oil, garlic, salt, and often other ingredients.\nIn the Philippines, mung bean sprouts are called togue and are most commonly used in lumpia rolls called lumpiang togue.In India, mung bean sprouts are cooked with green chili, garlic, and other spices.\nIn Indonesia the food are often used as fillings like tahu isi (stuffed tofu) and complementary ingredient in many dishes such as rawon and soto.\nIn Japan, the sprouts are called moyashi.\n\nStarch\nMung bean starch, which is extracted from ground mung beans, is used to make transparent cellophane noodles (also known as bean thread noodles, bean threads, glass noodles, fensi (\u7c89\u7d72), tung hoon (\u51ac\u7c89), mi\u1ebfn, b\u00fan t\u00e0u, or b\u00fan t\u00e0o). Cellophane noodles become soft and slippery when they are soaked in hot water. A variation of cellophane noodles, called mung bean sheets or green bean sheets, are also available.\nIn Korea, a jelly called nokdumuk (Korean: \ub179\ub450\ubb35; also called cheongpomuk, \uccad\ud3ec\ubb35) is made from mung bean starch; a similar jelly, colored yellow with the addition of gardenia coloring, is called hwangpomuk (\ud669\ud3ec\ubb35).\nIn northern China, mung bean jelly is called liangfen (\u6dbc\u7c89; 'chilled bean jelly'), which is a very popular food during summer. The Hokkiens add sugar to mung bean jelly to make it a dessert called Lio\u030dk-t\u0101u h\u00fan-k\u00f3e (\u7da0\u8c46\u7c89\u7cbf; 'mung bean flour cake').\n\nPlant-based protein\nMung beans are increasingly used in plant-based meat and egg alternatives such as Beyond Meat and Eat Just's Just Egg.\n\nHistory of domestication and cultivation\nThe mung bean was domesticated in India, where its progenitor (Vigna radiata subspecies sublobata) occurs wild.Carbonized mung beans have been discovered in many archeological sites in India. Areas with early finds include the eastern zone of the Harappan civilisation in modern-day Pakistan and western and northwestern India, where finds date back about 4,500 years, and South India in the modern state of Karnataka where finds date back more than 4,000 years. Some scholars, therefore, infer two separate domestications in the northwest and south of India. In South India, there is evidence for the evolution of larger-seeded mung beans 3,500 to 3,000 years ago. By about 3500 years ago mung beans were widely cultivated throughout India.\nCultivated mung beans later spread from India to China and Southeast Asia. Archaeobotanical research at the site of Khao Sam Kaeo in southern Thailand indicates that mung beans had arrived in Thailand by at least 2,200 years ago.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"mung bean Vigna radiata\".

extract. The original product was the beef stock cube, and the company now also markets chicken and other flavour cubes, including versions with Chinese and Indian spices. The cubes are broken up and used as flavouring in meals or gravy or dissolved into boiling water to produce a bouillon.\nIn the United Kingdom, the OXO brand belongs to Premier Foods. In South Africa, the Oxo brand is owned and manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and in Canada is owned and manufactured by Knorr.\n\nHistory\nAround 1840, Justus von Liebig developed a concentrated meat extract. Liebig's Extract of Meat Company (Lemco; established in the United Kingdom) promoted it, starting in 1866. The original product was a viscous liquid, containing only meat extract and 4% salt. In 1899, the company introduced the trademark Oxo; the origin of the name is unknown, but presumably comes from the word \"ox.\" Since the cost of liquid Oxo remained beyond the reach of many families, the company launched a research project to develop a solid version that could be sold in cubes for a penny. After much research, Oxo produced their first cubes in 1910 and further increased Oxo's popularity. During World War I, 100 million Oxo cubes were provided to the British armed forces, all of them individually hand-wrapped.The Vestey Group acquired Lemco in 1924, and the factory was renamed El Anglo. Vestey merged with Brooke Bond in 1968, which was in turn acquired by Unilever in 1984. Unilever sold the Oxo brand to the Campbell Soup Company in 2001, and Premier Foods bought Campbell's UK operation in 2006. This sale included sites at both Worksop and Kings Lynn. The Worksop plant currently produces Oxo cubes.\nIn South Africa, Oxo is now a brand of Mars, Incorporated. The only product marketed under the Oxo brand in South Africa was a yeast-extract-based spread. The product also contained a small portion of beef extract, giving it a slightly \"beefier\" taste than other yeast extracts. At the beginning of 2015, Mars Consumer Products Africa (Pty), Ltd discontinued Oxo spread in South Africa, with no prior communication to the public.\n\nMarketing\nIn 1908, Oxo (alongside Odol mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder) was one of the sponsors of the London Olympic Games (despite claims by Coca-Cola of being the \"first\" commercial sponsor of the games) and supplied marathon runners with Oxo drinks \"to fortify them.\" During the first half of the 20th century, Oxo was promoted through the issue of recipes, gifts, and sponsorships, before fading into the background as a part of the fabric of English life in the latter parts of the century.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company acquired the a Wharf on the south bank of the river Thames in London. There they erected a factory, demolishing most of the original building and constructing a tower, with distinctive windows appearing to spell out 'OXO', which became known as the Oxo TowerIn 1958, Oxo commenced their longest running television advertising campaign, \"Life with Katie.\" Katie was played by Mary Holland, and her long-suffering husband by Peter Moynihan. The campaign ran until the early 1970s, including two seasons where the family traveled to the US to film. By this time, the couple were joined by their \"son.\"\nAs styles and tastes changed, Oxo moved to a more up-to-date format with Dennis Waterman as the sole face of the brand in the mid '70s.\nIn 1966, Oxo had a sponsored show on the offshore radio station, Wonderful Radio London. The show was presented by Tony Windsor; his assistant was a woman called \"Katie.\" Oxo presented a new recipe in each episode.\nOxo launched another long-running advertising campaign in the UK in 1983, when a second \"Oxo Family\" debuted on commercial television.  The father was played by Michael Redfern, the mother was played by Lynda Bellingham, while the children were played by Blair MacKichan, Colin McCoy and Alison Reynolds. The advertisements typically featured the family sitting down to a meal at which Oxo gravy would be served.  The product was not always mentioned by name, occasionally appearing only as a logo in the corner of the screen at the end of the commercial.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the family were seen to grow older, and, when the campaign was retired in 1999, the family moved out of the house.\nOn 11 November 2014, it was announced that a 1984 Oxo advert starring Lynda Bellingham would be screened on Christmas Day as a tribute to the actress, who had died of colon cancer the previous month. It was aired during a commercial break of Coronation Street.\n\nSee also\nBovril\nOxo Tower\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nHistory of Campbell Soup UK", "pages": ["1908 Summer Olympics", "Beef", "Blair MacKichan", "Bouillon cube", "Bovril", "Brooke Bond", "Campbell Soup Company", "Chicken (food)", "Coca-Cola", "Coronation Street", "Cuisine of China", "Food", "ISBN (identifier)", "Indian cuisine", "Justus von Liebig", "Kings Lynn", "Knorr (brand)", "Liebig's Extract of Meat Company", "London", "Lynda Bellingham", "Mars, Incorporated", "Meat extract", "Michael Redfern", "OXO (kitchen utensils brand)", "Ox", "Oxo Tower", "Penny", "Premier Foods", "Thames", "Unilever", "United Kingdom", "Vestey Group", "Wonderful Radio London", "Worksop", "World War I", "Yeast extract", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Wikipedia:Verifiability", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Help:Referencing for beginners", "Category:Articles needing additional references from January 2008", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from May 2013"]}, "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from July 2021": {"body": "Peanut Butter is a product of peanuts used in sauces, cookies, crackers (and other baked goods), breakfast cereals and ice cream.'Peanut paste' is the main ingredient in some peanut butter recipes.\n\nMethod\nPeanut paste is obtained by several methods in which raw peanuts are roasted, blanched, and ground to create the peanut paste.\n\nDistinction from peanut butter\nThe distinction between peanut paste and peanut butter is not always clear cut in ordinary use.\n\nFood labelling in Australia\nThe term has been used in Queensland, Australia, as a synonym for peanut butter. This followed pressure from dairy farmers who did not want peanut butter competing with butter for market share.The product was known in Western Australia and South Australia for many years as peanut paste because, by definition, butter is a dairy product. The same product was available in other states as peanut butter. Manufacturers complained about having to produce different labels for different states and the Western Australian government changed the rules on the use of the word butter to allow for one set of labels.\n\nAs ingredient of peanut butter\nPeanut butter may be made from peanut paste mixed with a stabilizing agent, a sweetening agent, salt, and optionally, an emulsifying agent. In such formulas, peanut paste acts as the main ingredient in peanut butter, from 75% to as much as 99% of the recipe. Peanut butter is mainly known for being sold as a spread, and peanut paste is regularly sold to be used as an ingredient in cookies, cakes and a number of other retail food products.\n\nSee also\nList of peanut dishes\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Baked goods", "Breakfast cereal", "Butter", "Cracker (food)", "Emulsifying agent", "HealthDay", "Ice cream", "List of peanut dishes", "Peanut", "Peanut butter", "Peanut butter cookie", "Peanut sauce", "Queensland", "Stabilizing agent", "Synonym", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from January 2021", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from July 2021"]}, "Category:Articles with topics of unclear notability from July 2017": {"body": "Pheasant paste is a type of p\u00e2t\u00e9 made from pheasant meat and other common p\u00e2t\u00e9 ingredients such as sour cream, eggs, onions and butter.\n\nSee also\nList of spreads\nPheasant under glass \u2013 a pheasant dish\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Butter", "Common pheasant", "Egg (food)", "Ingredient", "List of spreads", "Meat", "Onion", "Pheasant under glass", "P\u00e2t\u00e9", "Sour cream", "Wikipedia:Deletion policy", "Wikipedia:Independent sources", "Wikipedia:Merging", "Wikipedia:Notability", "Wikipedia:Redirect", "Wikipedia:Reliable sources", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Category:Articles with topics of unclear notability from July 2017"]}, "Template talk:Palestine-stub": {"body": "Qizha (Arabic \u0642\u0632\u062d\u0629 qiz\u1e25a\u1e97, pronounced \u02bc\u025bz\u1e25a in Palestine) is a black seed paste used in Palestinian cuisine. Made from crushed nigella seeds, the paste has a sharp, bitter taste with slight tones of sweetness. The paste can be used with other condiments, such as tahini, or baked into pies, breads, and pastries.\n\nProduction\nQizha is made from the seeds of Nigella sativa of the buttercup family of plants, which is native to the Middle East and India. The seeds, sometimes known as \"black cumin\", are soaked in salt water for a night, oven roasted, left on rocks to dry in the sun, and finally ground to make a paste.

It is used to impart an intense tomato flavour to a variety of dishes, such as pasta, soups and braised meat. It is used as an ingredient in many world cuisines.\nBy contrast, tomato pur\u00e9e is a liquid with a thinner consistency than tomato paste, while tomato sauce is even thinner in consistency.\n\nHistory and traditions\nTomato paste is traditionally made in parts of Sicily, southern Italy and Malta by spreading out a much-reduced tomato sauce on wooden boards that are set outdoors under the hot August sun to dry the paste until it is thick enough, when it is scraped up and held together in a richly-colored dark ball. Today, this artisan product is harder to find than the thinner industrial version. Commercial production uses tomatoes with thick pericarp walls and lower overall moisture; these are very different from tomatoes typically found in a supermarket.\nTomato paste became commercially available in the early 20th century.\n\nRegional differences\nIn the UK, tomato paste is also referred to as concentrate. In the US, tomato paste is simply concentrated tomato solids (no seeds or skin), sometimes with added sweetener (high fructose corn syrup), and with a standard of identity (in the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR 155.191).  Tomato pur\u00e9e has a lower tomato soluble solids requirement, the cutoff being 24%. For comparison, typical fresh round tomatoes have a soluble solid content of 3.5\u20135.5% (refractometric Brix), while cherry tomatoes have double the amount.\n\nUses\nTomato paste is added to dishes to impart an intense flavour, particularly the natural umami flavour found in tomatoes. Examples of dishes in which tomato paste may be commonly used include pasta sauces, soups, and braised meat. The paste is typically added early in the cooking process and saut\u00e9ed to achieve caramelization.Based on the manufacturing conditions, the paste can be the basis for making ketchup or reconstituted tomato juice:\n\nHot break: heated to about 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F), pectin is preserved, paste is thicker and can be used for ketchup\nWarm break: heated to about 79 \u00b0C (174 \u00b0F), colour is not preserved, but flavour is preserved\nCold break: heated to about 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F), colour and flavour are preserved, so it can be reconstituted into juice\n\nSee also\nChili sauce and paste\nList of tomato dishes\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Braising", "Caramelization", "Chili sauce and paste", "Code of Federal Regulations", "Cuisine", "High fructose corn syrup", "ISBN (identifier)", "Ketchup", "List of tomato dishes", "Malta", "Paste (food)", "Pectin", "Pericarp", "Reduction (cooking)", "Saut\u00e9ed", "Sicily", "Southern Italy", "Tomato", "Tomato juice", "Tomato pur\u00e9e", "Tomato sauce", "Umami", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers", "Help:Authority control", "Category:Articles with GND identifiers", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from January 2023", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from September 2023", "Category:Vague or ambiguous time from January 2023"]}, "Category:Hummus": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Nut dishes": {"body": "", "pages": ["Category:Nut dishes"]}, "Category:Chili paste": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Swallows (food)": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Raw foods": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "United States": {"body": "Cerealine, also known as malt flakes, was a 19th-century American cereal product and the first dry breakfast food in American retailing. Similar to but predating corn flakes, which appeared in 1898 and are first rolled and then toasted, cerealine is corn grits in the form of uncooked flakes. It was originally used by the brewing industry.\nMore popularly, Toasted Cerealine Flakes, colloquially called simply Cerealine, was also the brand name for raw-flake cereal made from grits by the Cerealine Manufacturing Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, and its successor concern, the American Hominy Company.\n\nHistory\nCorn grits in the form of uncooked flakes, known as cerealine, was used for beer brewing as of at least the mid-19th century, with Aurora, Indiana's T. & J.W. Gaff & Co. distillery building the Cerealine Mill at 607 Jackson Street in Columbus, Indiana, in 1867. Their Cerealine Manufacturing Company moved to Indianapolis, Indiana sometime prior to 1898, though the Columbus mill's building remained extant and was restored in the late 20th or early 21st century for use as a cafeteria and conference center by the engine manufacturing corporation Cummins Inc. Prior to being annexed by Indianapolis in 1895, the settlement around what was then called the Cerealine Works was known as Cerealinetown.\nWhite-corn cerealine flakes as a breakfast cereal were invented, perhaps accidentally, by Columbus, Indiana, mill worker James Vannoy circa 1884 or 1887. Vannoy's 1902 obituary said he found through experimentation a way to run the milled grain through rollers so that it would come out \"in thin layers or flakes.  He went to his employer, Joseph F. Gent, with the discovery. Gent rather disregarded the wonderful discovery and told Vannoy that he had better been tending to his duties. Later, Gent had the discovery patented, and it was not long until Cerealine was on the market and was being sold in large quantities.\"Cerealine was well established as a breakfast food by at least 1897, when the Illinois Farmer's Institute annual report noted that, \"Some mills make hominy of white corn, roll it into broad, flat flakes, called cerealine, which are used here as a breakfast dish....\" By this time it had become one of the three most popular cereals of that time, along with cracked wheat and oatmeal.  All three were typically sold by retailers who bought cereal in barrel lots and scooped it out to sell by the pound to customers. Toasted Cerealine Flakes was later sold in packages.In 1902, the Cerealine Manufacturing Company was consolidated with Indianapolis Hominy Mills; the Hudmet Company, of Missouri and Indiana; the Pratt Cereal Mill, of Decatur, Illinois; the Hamburg Milling Company and the Shellabarger Mill and Elevator Company, also  of Decatur; the M.M. Wright Company, of Danville, Illinois; the Miami Maize Company, of Toledo, Ohio; and the Purity Oats Company, of Iowa, to form the American Hominy Company, based in Indianapolis.A 1907 trade journal reported the company was reintroducing the cereal Toasted Cerealine Flakes, commenting that it would sound:\n\n...familiar to the man who has a good memory. The American Hominy Co. is introducing this \"new\" flaked corn product in the East and the sale is going well. \"Cerealine\" will be remembered as an uncooked pure white cornflake sold several years ago all over the country. As a basis, \"Cerealine\" made some very appetizing dishes in its day. \"Cerealine\" enjoyed a wide sale, but its manufacture had to give way finally, we presume. to the increased production of ready prepared cereal foods.\n\"Toasted Cerealine Flakes,\" or \"Modern Cerealine\"\u2014if half as good as the old article, will no doubt meet with a cordial reception in this market when the time comes for its introduction.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCarson, Gerald (1957). \"Cornflake Crusade\".

In addition to being an ingredient to sushi of various types, they are used as a rice bowl topping, forming negitorodon.\n\nEtymology\nMultiple hypotheses exist.\n\nCombination of green onion and toro part of tuna\nNegitoro is so named because it is a combination of green onion (Japanese: \u30cd\u30ae, romanized: Negi), and toro (Japanese: \u30c8\u30ed, romanized: toro, fatty parts of tuna).Since the 1980s, with the appearance of new toro sushi combined with pungent vegetables, the well-matched taste and combination of toro, green onion and nori seaweed have become popular.\n\nToro referring to something other than part of tuna\nOne of the restaurants hypothesized as the origin of the dish claims the dish was so named based on mugitoro, a dish that was popular around the place at the time.\n\nNegi referring to something other than green onion\nIn the field of construction in Japan, digging soil from the ground to constructing building is termed negiru (Japanese: \u6839\u5207\u308b), and it was hypothesized that the term adopted into negiru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u308b) or negitoru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u53d6\u308b) to refer to meat being scraped. Tuna fishing groups support the hypothesis. However, dictionary editors question the hypothesis, claiming there is no verifiable usage of the verb form of the adopted word negitoru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u53d6\u308b), and thus the hypothesis cannot be sustained. It has been suggested the negitoru origin hypothesis emerged after the 2000s, and until the 1990s the mainstream hypothesis on the origin of the negitoro dish was that the term is a combination of green onion (Japanese: \u30cd\u30ae, romanized: Negi) and toro (Japanese: \u30c8\u30ed, romanized: toro).\n\nMass-market product\nNegitoro sold to the mass market and distributed into retail channels like supermarkets is mass-produced in fish factories. They use lean meat of various fishes, including, for example, yellowfin tuna, marlin, bigeye tuna, and albacore,  then adding additives like vegetable oil, shortening, lard, antioxidants, and condiments. Dedicated fat products for the purpose of negitoro manufacturing have also been produced.Japanese consumer groups and magazines have raised concerns about such practices being possibly misleading and raising potential health concerns. However, there are also claims that unprocessed tuna scrape is not popular.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nAsahiya Publishing, ed. (1978). \u3059\u3057\u306e\u96d1\u8a8c\u7b2c6\u96c6.

However, no clear benefit to consumption has been found, and the medical community notes there is increased risk of contracting dangerous milk borne diseases from these products. Substantial evidence of this increased risk, combined with a lack of any clear benefit, has led countries around the world to either prohibit the sale of raw milk or require warning labels on packaging when sold.\nIn countries where it is available for sale, its availability and regulations around its sale vary. In the European Union, individual member states can prohibit or restrict the sale of raw milk, but it is not banned outright; in some member states, the sale of raw milk through vending machines is permitted, though the packaging will typically instruct consumers to boil before consumption. In the United States, some dairies have adopted low-temperature vat pasteurization, which they say produces a product similar to raw milk.\n\nHistory of raw milk and pasteurization\nHumans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 9000\u20137000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500\u20133000 BC in the Americas. The most important dairy animals\u2014cattle, sheep and goats\u2014were first domesticated in Mesopotamia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. From there dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but not reaching Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000\u20135500 BC).\nPasteurization is widely used to prevent infected milk from entering the food supply. The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage.\nAfter sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s. This move successfully controlled the spread of highly contagious bacterial diseases including E. coli, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis (all thought to be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk). In the early days after the scientific discovery of bacteria, there was no product testing to determine whether a farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk was treated as potentially contagious. After the first tests were developed, some farmers took steps to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, sometimes even falsifying test results to make their animals appear free of infection. Recent advances in the analysis of milk-borne diseases have enabled scientists to track the DNA of the infectious bacteria to the cows on the farms that supplied the raw milk.The recognition of many potentially deadly pathogens, such as E. coli 0157 H7, Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella, and their possible presence in poorly produced milk products has led to the continuation of pasteurization. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies of the United States strongly recommend that the public do not consume raw milk or raw milk products. Young children, the elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are more susceptible to infections originating in raw milk.\n\nUses\nA number of cheeses are produced with raw milk although local statutes vary regarding what if any health precautions must be followed such as aging cheese for a certain amount of time. A large proportion of the US population eats several different cheeses made with raw milk, including aged Gouda cheese.\nThe first camembert was made from raw milk, and the Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) variety \"Camembert de Normandie\" (approximately 10% of all camembert production) is required by law to be made only with unpasteurized milk. Many modern cheesemakers, however, use pasteurized milk for reasons of safety, compliance with regulations, or convenience.A thick mixture known as syllabub was created by milkmaids squirting milk directly from a cow into a container of cider, beer or other beverage.Raw yak milk is allowed to ferment overnight to become yak butter.\n\nHealth effects\nInfectivity\nThe potential pathogenic bacteria from raw milk include tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid, Campylobacter, Listeria, Brucella, E. coli, Salmonella, and streptococcal infections, make it potentially unsafe to consume. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that \"raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption.\"Even with precautions and cold storage (optimally 3\u20134 \u00b0C (37\u201339 \u00b0F)), raw milk has a shelf life of 3 to 5 days.\n\nEpidemiology\nBefore pasteurized milk was adopted in the US, public health officials were concerned with cow milk transmission of bovine tuberculosis to humans, with an estimated 10% of all tuberculosis cases in humans being attributed to milk consumption. Along with specific diseases, officials continue to be concerned about outbreaks. With the use of modern pasteurization and sanitation practices milk accounts for less than 1% of reported outbreaks from food and water consumption. By comparison, raw milk was associated with 25% of all disease outbreaks from food/water during the time before World War II in the U.S. From a public health standpoint, pasteurization has decreased the percentage of milk associated food/water borne outbreaks.\nBetween 2007 and 2016, there were 144 outbreaks connected to raw milk consumption in the United States. Because raw milk production skips the pasteurization process, the germs that are normally removed remain in the milk product. Exposure to raw milk containing harmful germs poses a threat of infection, resulting from bacteria including Camplyobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella. Additionally, depending on the severity of infection, there may be further threat to human health. Infection has the potential to induce serious illness such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Because of the vulnerability of developing and degrading immune systems, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised are at a heightened risk of experiencing infection from raw milk consumption.Outbreaks have occurred in the past from consuming food products made with raw milk. One of the potential pathogens in raw milk, Listeria monocytogenes, can survive the pasteurization process and contaminate post-pasteurization environments. Milk and dairy products made with that milk then become recontaminated. Consistent contamination persists by bacteria survival in biofilms within the processing systems.\nOne food item that has commonly used raw milk in its production in the past is cheese. Several different types of cheeses made with raw milk are consumed by a large portion of the United States population, including soft cheeses. Since Gouda cheese has a 60-day aging period prior to its consumption, it has previously been hypothesized that no bacteria would persist through that time. A review study published in the Journal of Food Protection showed that E. coli 0157:H7 has the ability to persist through the aging period of Gouda cheese. The study's evidence included three different outbreaks prior to 2013 associated with this specific strain of E. coli in Gouda.\n\nNutrition and allergy\n\"With the exception of an altered organoleptic [flavor] profile, heating (particularly ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\"Raw milk advocates, such as the Weston A. Price Foundation, say that raw milk can be produced hygienically, and that it has health benefits that are destroyed in the pasteurization process. Research shows only very slight differences in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk.Proponents of raw milk in the US typically argue that while pasteurization may kill dangerous bacteria, it also kills off good bacteria claimed to have health benefits not present in pasteurized milk. The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that this is false, and that pasteurizing milk does not destroy any of its nutritional value.One study used mice to evaluate the difference in nutritional values between raw and pasteurized milk. Mice were separated into two groups: a pasteurized milk group and a raw milk group. Each group consisted of breeding pairs. The conclusion of the study measured no significant difference in weights of pasteurized to raw milk consuming mice. Birth weights were measured from each group and showed no significant differences between groups. Overall the study showed no measurable significant difference in nutritional value in growth and fertility of mice.Three studies have found an inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures on the basis of consumption or nonconsumption of raw milk. Aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle have been suggested as having a role in these differences, and for this reason, the overall phenomenon has been named the \"farm effect\". A recent scientific review concluded that \"most studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation of the raw milk's status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.\" For example, in the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma, and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis; \"the effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items themselves or their diversity.\"\n\nLegal status\nRegulation of the commercial distribution of packaged raw milk varies around the world. Some countries have complete bans, but many do not restrict the purchase of raw milk bought directly from the farmer. Raw milk is sometimes distributed through a program, in which the consumer owns a share in the dairy animal or the herd, and therefore can be considered to be consuming milk from their own animal, which is legal. Raw milk is sometimes marketed for animal or pet consumption, or for other uses such as soap making in places where sales for human consumption are prohibited.\n\nAfrica\nAlthough milk consumption in Africa is fairly low compared to the rest of the world, in tribes where milk consumption is popular, such as the Maasai tribe, milk is typically consumed unpasteurized.\n\nAsia\nIn rural areas of Asia where milk consumption is popular, milk is typically unpasteurized. In large cities of Asia, raw milk, especially from water buffalo, is typical. In most countries of Asia, laws prohibiting raw milk are nonexistent or rarely enforced. Milk labelled as \"raw\" (nama) is available in Japan, but the designation means it is 100% raw whole milk before being pasteurized. Unpasteurized milk is very uncommon in Japan. In Singapore, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is prohibited due to safety concerns outlined by the Singapore Food Agency.In India, milk is often drunk raw, although milk supplied in major cities is sometimes pasteurized. Pasteurized or not, milk is often boiled in homes before consumption.\n\nEurope\nIn the European Union it is required that raw milk and products made with raw milk must be labelled to indicate this. Under EU hygiene rules, member states can prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of raw milk intended for human consumption. Individual member states are also free to implement their own stricter requirements. Usually special sanitary regulations and frequent quality tests (at least once per month) are mandatory.\n\nFrance\nRaw milk cheeses make up about 18 per cent of France's total cheese production, and are considered far superior to cheeses made from pasteurised milk. Many French cuisine traditionalists consider pasteurized cheeses almost a sacrilege. Many traditional French cheeses have solely been made from raw milk for hundreds of years. Unpasteurised cheese in France is the major source of staphylococcal food poisoning.\n\nGermany\nIn Germany, packaged raw milk may be sold in shops under the name Vorzugsmilch. The raw milk has to be packed before vending, with the necessary information (producer, shelf life, and special warnings) written on the product. The distribution license has stringent quality restrictions; as of 2012, just 80 farmers in Germany had a license.Unpackaged raw milk may only be sold under specific conditions. It must:\n\nonly be sold at the farm where it was produced\nbe from the day of or the day before production\nhave a warning label \"Raw Milk \u2013 boil before use\"Packed raw milk is sold widely in all health food stores, large supermarkets, gourmet delis and delicatessen sections of department stores. Raw milk is legally sold in the entire country, and the same goes for raw milk cheeses, which are especially sought out and promoted by the health food and slow food movements.\n\nIreland\nIn the Republic of Ireland, raw milk is legal and its sale and production is regulated by the Department of Agriculture. While raw milk was previously banned in Irish law, since 2015, raw milk production has been regulated in accordance with the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations (2009). Farmers wishing to produce more than 30 litres (6.6 imp gal; 7.9 US gal) of raw milk for human consumption are required to register with the department's Milk Hygiene Division and consent to random sampling of their products as well as regular inspections of their production facilities. The sale and consumption of raw milk has been discouraged by various food safety experts, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.\n\nNordic states\nShops are not permitted to sell unpasteurised milk to consumers in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. All four countries allow limited \"barn door\" sales subject to strict controls. As of 2015, just one distributor in Denmark is licensed to supply restaurants with raw milk from approved farms. Pasteurisation of milk became common practice in Denmark and Sweden in the mid-1880s.\n\nSlovenia\nRaw milk has been available from refrigerated milk vending machines (mlekomati) all over the country since 2010. The milk sold in the machines is subject to stringent regular control.\nAs of 2018, raw milk is also available in shops. The Slovenian National Institute of Public Health advises that consumption of fresh milk from a milk machine that is not heat-treated (boiled) can pose a risk to health.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nAbout 150 producers of raw milk are listed with the Food Standards Agency in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They sell raw, or \"green top\" milk directly to consumers either at the farm, at a farmers' market, or through a delivery service, as it is legal to supply unpasteurised raw milk directly to consumers, but illegal to be sold to a shop. The bottle must display the warning \"this product has not been heat-treated and may contain organisms harmful to health\", and the milk must conform to higher hygiene standards than dairies producing only pasteurised milk.It is an offence to place raw milk or cream on the market for direct consumption in Scotland, following a spate of deaths in 1983.\n\nNorth America\nCanada\nThe sale of raw milk directly to consumers has been prohibited in Canada under the Food and Drug Regulations since 1991.\n\nNo person shall sell the normal lacteal secretion obtained from the mammary gland of the cow, genus Bos, or of any other animal, or sell a dairy product made with any such secretion, unless the secretion or dairy product has been pasteurized by being held at a temperature and for a period that ensure the reduction of the alkaline phosphatase activity so as to meet the tolerances specified in official method MFO-3, Determination of Phosphatase Activity in Dairy Products, dated November 30, 1981.\nProvincial laws also forbid the sale and distribution of raw milk. For instance, Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act, subsection 18(1) reads: \"No person shall sell, offer for sale, deliver or distribute milk or cream that has not been pasteurized or sterilized in a plant that is licensed under the Milk Act or in a plant outside Ontario that meets the standards for plants licensed under the Milk Act.\"\nIn January 2010, Michael Schmidt was found not guilty on 19 charges relating to the sale of raw milk in the Ontario Court of Justice. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, that decision was overturned. Schmidt was convicted on thirteen counts and imposed fines totaling $9,150 and one year of probation. A subsequent appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed.In British Columbia, Alice Jongerden, Michael Schmidt and Gordon Watson\u2014persons involved in the operation of her raw milk dairy\u2014attempted to avoid enforcement of a judgement against them under the Public Health Act by challenging the constitutionality of the legislation, which deems raw milk to be a hazardous product, on the grounds that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This argument, and other defenses invoked by her and defendants in her business, was rejected in 2013 by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which instead found Schmidt and Watson guilty of civil contempt, and sentenced them to a 3-month suspended sentence imprisonment with a probationary period of 1 year during which \"Any repetition of this contempt ... will trigger the imposed sentence imprisonment of 3 months.\" They were also charged special costs.\nMeanwhile, Canada does permit the sale of raw milk cheeses that are aged over 60 days. In 2009, the province of Quebec modified regulations to allow raw milk cheeses aged less than 60 days provided stringent safeguards are met.\n\nUnited States\nIn the early 20th century, many states within the United States allowed the sale of raw milk that was certified by a \"medical milk commission\", effectively allowing an alternative of extra inspection for pasteurization. In the present day, most states impose restrictions on raw milk suppliers due to concerns about safety. 43 U.S. states allow the sale of raw milk. Cow shares can be found, and raw milk purchased for animal consumption in many states where retail for human consumption is prohibited. The sale of raw milk cheese is permitted as long as the cheese has been aged for 60 days or more.The FDA reports that, in 2002, consuming partially heated raw milk and raw milk products caused 200 Americans to become ill in some manner.Many governmental officials and the majority of public health organizations hold to the need for pasteurization. Before pasteurization, many dairies, especially in cities, fed their cattle on low-quality feed, resulting in the production of milk rife with dangerous bacteria. Pasteurizing it was the only way to make it safely drinkable. The Cornell University Food Science Department has compiled data indicating that pathogenic microorganisms are present in between 0.87% and 12.6% of raw milk samples.Proponents also invoke the benefits of direct-marketing when promoting the sale of raw milk. The ability of the farmer to eliminate the middle-man and sell directly to the consumer allows for greater profitability. Many manufacturers sell small-scale pasteurization equipment, thereby allowing farmers to both bypass the milk processors and sell pasteurized milk directly to the consumer. Additionally, some small U.S. dairies are now beginning to adopt low-temperature vat pasteurization. Advocates of low-temperature vat pasteurization note that it produces a product similar to raw milk in composition.\nFood freedom advocates cite libertarian arguments in claiming a basic civil right of each person to weigh the risks and benefits in choosing the food one eats, including the choice to consume raw milk.\n\nOceania\nAustralia\nThe sale of raw milk for drinking purposes is illegal in all states and territories in Australia, as is all raw milk cheese. This has been circumvented somewhat by selling raw milk as bath milk. An exception to the cheese rule has been made recently for two Roquefort cheeses. There is some indication of share owning cows, allowing the \"owners\" to consume the raw milk, but also evidence that the government is trying to close this loophole.On 8 November 2015, four-year-old Apu Khangura died of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and seven other children became seriously ill, following the consumption of raw milk. In response, the Victorian government created new regulations which require producers to treat raw milk to reduce pathogens, or to make the product unpalatable to taste, such as making it bitter.\n\nNew Zealand\nRaw milk for drinking and raw milk products can be made and sold in New Zealand, but are highly regulated to offset the pathogen risk. Producers of raw milk for sale to consumers must be registered.

Due to the sour plums used in its production, suanmeitang is slightly salty in addition to being sweet and rather sour.\nSuanmeitang is commercially available in China and other parts of the world with Chinese communities. It is often drunk chilled during the summertime, as relief from the heat, and is one of the most common summer drinks in China. In addition to being widely considered an effective drink for cooling off in the heat, it is also popularly believed to have minor health benefits, such as improving digestion and possibly inhibiting the buildup of lactic acid in the body.\n\nHistory\nSuanmeitang has existed in some form for over 1,000 years, at least since the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 CE); there are also reports of a variation called \"white suanmeitang\" (\u767d\u9178\u6885\u6c64) during the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368 CE). The recipe used today is thought to have been developed at the request of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty during the early 18th century, at which time it was first common in the imperial courts, and was later popularized among common folk when a Hebei citizen created and produced the Xinyuanzhai (\u4fe1\u8fdc\u658b) brand. By the 1980s, companies had begun to use industrial methods and technology to mass-produce suanmeitang.\n\nIngredients and production\nSuanmeitang is made by first soaking sour plums in water, then adding haw, liquorice root, and sweet osmanthus and boiling them together. Rose blossoms may also be added. After the mixture is boiled, rock sugar is added to the residue, it is boiled again, and after the beverage has cooled off it is chilled.\n\nSee also\nUmeshu \u2013 Japanese liqueur\nMaesil-ju \u2013 Korean plum wine\nPrune juice\nList of plum dishes\nList of smoked foods\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Beijing This Month", "Cantonese", "China Daily", "Crataegus pinnatifida", "Hanyu Pinyin", "Hebei", "Hokkien", "Hong Kong Commercial Daily", "ISBN (identifier)", "Jyutping", "Lactic acid", "Liquorice", "List of plum dishes", "List of smoked foods", "Lonely Planet", "Maesil-ju", "Osmanthus", "Osmanthus fragrans", "Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b", "Prune juice", "Qianlong Emperor", "Qing dynasty", "Rock candy", "Rose", "Simplified Chinese characters", "Smoked plum", "Song dynasty", "Southern Min", "Standard Chinese", "The Standard (Hong Kong)", "Traditional Chinese characters", "Travel In Taiwan", "Umeshu", "Yuan dynasty", "Template:Cite web", "Help:CS1 errors", "Category:CS1 maint: postscript", "Portal:Drink"]}, "Category:Raw egg dishes": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Raw sausages": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Uncooked fish dishes": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Uncooked meat dishes": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Spit-cooked foods": {"body": "", "pages": ["Category:Spit-cooked foods"]}, "Category:Articles with NKC identifiers": {"body": "An ice cream bar is a frozen dessert featuring ice cream on a stick.

Unlike ice cream or sorbet, which are whipped while freezing to prevent ice crystal formation, an ice pop is frozen while at rest, becoming  a solid block of ice. The stick is used as a handle to hold it. Without a stick, the frozen product would be a freezie.\nAn ice pop is also referred to as a popsicle in Canada and the United States, a paleta in Mexico, the Southwestern United States and parts of Latin America, an ice lolly or lolly ice in the United Kingdom and Ireland, an ice block in New Zealand and Australia, an ice drop in the Philippines, an ice gola in India, ice candy in the Philippines, India and Japan, ai tim tang or ice cream tang in Thailand, and a kisko in the Caribbean. The term icy pole is often used in Australia, but is a brand name.\n\nHistory\nAs far back as 1872, two men, doing business as Ross and Robbins, sold a frozen-fruit confection on a stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey.Francis William \"Frank\" Epperson of Oakland, California, popularized ice pops after patenting the concept of \"frozen ice on a stick\" in 1923.Epperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905, at the age of 11, when he accidentally left a glass of powdered lemonade soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story still printed on the back of Popsicle treat boxes.\nEpperson lived in Oakland and worked as a lemonade salesman.In 1922, Epperson, a realtor with Realty Syndicate Company in Oakland,introduced the Popsicle at a fireman's ball. The product got traction quickly; in 1923, at the age of 29, Epperson received a patent for his \"Epsicle\" ice pop, and by 1924, had patented all handled, frozen confections or ice lollipops. He officially debuted the Epsicle in seven fruit flavors at Neptune Beach amusement park, marketed as a \"frozen lollipop\", or a \"drink on a stick\".A couple of years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City.\n\nTerminology\nIn the United States and Canada, frozen ice on a stick is generically referred to as a popsicle due to the early popularity of the Popsicle brand, and the word has become a genericized trademark to mean any ice pop, regardless of brand or format. The word is a portmanteau of pop and icicle; the word is genericized to such an extent that there are decades-old derived slang meanings such as \"popsicle stand\". The term ice pop is also used in the United States.In Ireland, the term ice pop is predominantly used. In the United Kingdom, the term ice lolly is used to refer to ice pop while the term ice pop refers to a freezie (flavoured ice inside a tube). The term chihiro is used as a slang term in the Cayman Islands, partially derived from chill. Different parts of Australia use either ice block or icy pole (which is a brand name), and New Zealand uses ice block. In the Philippines, the term ice drop is used with coconut flavor ice pops being called ice bukos. India uses the terms ice gola and ice candy. In Japan the term ice candy is used.\n\nPaleta\nAfter a trip to the United States in the early 1940s, Ignacio Alc\u00e1zar returned to his home city of Tocumbo, Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, bringing the idea to manufacture ice pops or paletas (little sticks) using locally available fresh fruit. He and some family members expanded by opening a shop in Mexico City which became very popular and he began to franchise Paleter\u00eda La Michoacana to friends and family from his town. The popularity of paletas and association with Tocumbo has increased to the status of a national Mexican food.Paleta flavors can be divided into two basic categories: milk-based or water-based. The composition of each flavor may vary, but the base is most often fruit. Paleterias usually have dozens of flavors of paleta including local flavors like horchata, tamarind, mamey and nanche along with other flavors like strawberry, lime, chocolate and mango. Distinctly Mexican ingredients like chili pepper, chamoy, and vanilla are often present in these paletas. Paleterias adapt their flavors to the tastes of the community and local availability of ingredients.\n\nPaletero\nA paletero (roughly equivalent to the English \"ice cream man\"), is a street seller of paletas and other frozen treats, usually from a pushcart labeled with the name of the enterprise that made the paletas (paleter\u00eda). Today, many paleteros are now commonly found in American cities with significant Mexican populations. Vending requirements for paleteros vary widely by city.\n\nHomemade ice pops\nAn alternative to the store-bought ice pops is making them at home using fruit juice, drinks, or any freezable beverage. A classic method involves using ice cube trays and toothpicks, although various ice pop freezer molds are also available.\nIn the UK, there is an increasing number of people making alcoholic ice lollies at home by putting alcoholic drinks inside the mould. Buckfast, Kopparberg and Strongbow Dark Fruit ciders are popular choices used.\n\nInnovations in ice pop creation\nIn 2018, the UK food-focused design firm called Bompas & Parr announced that they had created the world's first 'non-melting' ice pop. The ice pop does melt but not as fast as other ice pops. This is due to the strands of fruit fibers inside the ice pops which makes them thicker than regular ice pops. The thicker the ice pop the slower it melts. This design was inspired by the material called pykrete, which was invented by Geoffrey Pyke.\n\nWorld record ice pop\nOn June 22, 2005, Snapple tried to beat the existing Guinness World Records entry of a 1997 Dutch 21-foot (6.4 m) ice pop by attempting to erect a 25-foot (7.6 m) ice pop in New York City. The 17.5 short tons (15.9 t) of frozen juice that had been brought from Edison, New Jersey, in a freezer truck melted faster than expected, dashing hopes of a new record. Spectators fled to higher ground as firefighters hosed away the melted juice.\n\nSee also\nCreamsicle\nFreezie\u2014a.k.a. ice pole, similar to an ice pop, but without the stick\nIce cream\nIce cream bar\u2014similar to an ice pop, but made with ice cream\nLollipops\nSorbet\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nlaverr\u00e1n, Virginia Gonz\u00e1lez. \"Historia del Helado en M\u00e9xico By Martin Gonz\u00e1lez de la Vara\".

It is used as a filling in baking or  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. This sugar confection is inspired by a medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\n\nHistory\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000 BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.Whether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early to mid 19th century, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one to two days before the final product was produced. In the late 19th century, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.By the early 20th century, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.Modern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent.\n\nIngredients\nMarshmallows consist of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent/aerator (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics.  Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nThe marshmallow is a foam, consisting of an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous dispersed phase (in other words, a liquid with gas bubbles spread throughout). In addition to being a foam, this also makes marshmallows an \"aerated\" confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like a marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced into the system, tiny air bubbles are created. This is what contributes to the unique textural properties and mouth-feel of this product.\n\nProtein\nIn marshmallows, proteins are the main surface-active agents responsible for the formation, and stabilization of the dispersed air.  Due to their structure, surface-active molecules gather at the surface area of a portion of (water-based) liquid. A portion of each protein molecule is hydrophilic, with a polar charge, and another portion is hydrophobic and non-polar. The non-polar section has little or no affinity for water, and so this section orients as far away from the water as possible. However, the polar section is attracted to the water and has little or no affinity for the air. Therefore, the molecule orients with the polar section in the water, with the non-polar section in the air. Two primary proteins that are commonly used as aerators in marshmallows are albumen (egg whites) and gelatin.\n\nAlbumen (egg whites)\nAlbumen is a mixture of proteins found in egg whites and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to fresh egg whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. Fresh egg whites carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, fresh egg whites are usually used. Albumen is rarely used on its own when incorporated into modern marshmallows, and instead is used in conjunction with gelatin.\n\nGelatin\nGelatin is the aerator most often used in the production of marshmallows. It is made up of collagen, a structural protein derived from animal skin, connective tissue, and bones. Not only can it stabilize foams, like albumen, but when combined with water it forms a thermally-reversible gel. This means that gelatin can melt, then reset due to its sensitivity to temperature. The melting point of gelatin gel is around 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C), which is just below normal body temperature (around 97 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0C)). This is what contributes to the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" sensation when a marshmallow is consumed\u2014it actually starts to melt when it touches the tongue.During preparation, the temperature needs to be just above the melting point of the gelatin, so that as soon as it is formed it cools quickly, and the gelatin will set, retaining the desired shape. If the marshmallow rope mixture exiting the extruder during processing is too warm, the marshmallow starts to flow before the gelatin sets. Instead of a round marshmallow, it will take a more oval form. Excessive heat can also degrade, or break down, the gelatin itself. Therefore, when marshmallows are being produced at home or by artisan candy makers, the gelatin is added after the syrup has been heated and cooled down.\nIn commercial operations, the gelatin is simply cooked with the sugar syrup, rather than being added later after the syrup has cooled. In this case, kinetics play an important role, with both time and temperature factoring in. If the gelatin was added at the beginning of a batch that was then cooked to 112\u2013116 \u00b0C in 20\u201330 minutes, a significant amount of gelatin would break down. The marshmallow would have reduced springiness from that loss of gelatin. But since the time the syrup spends at elevated temperature in modern cookers is so short, there is little to no degradation of the gelatin.In terms of texture, and mouth-feel, gelatin makes marshmallows chewy by forming a tangled 3-D network of polymer chains.  Once gelatin is dissolved in warm water (dubbed the \"blooming stage\"), it forms a dispersion, which results in a cross-linking of its helix-shaped chains.  The linkages in the gelatin protein network trap air in the marshmallow mixture and immobilize the water molecules in the network. The result is the well-known spongy structure of marshmallows. This is why the omission of gelatin from a marshmallow recipe will result in marshmallow creme, since there is no gelatin network to trap the water and air bubbles.\n\nSugars\nA traditional marshmallow might contain about 60% corn syrup, 30% sugar, and 1\u20132% gelatin. A combination of different sugars is used to control the solubility of the solution. The corn syrup/sugar ratio will influence the texture by slowing crystallization of the sucrose. The smooth texture of marshmallows relies on disordered, or amorphous, sugar molecules. In contrast, increasing the sugar ratio to about 60\u201365% will produce a grainy marshmallow. Temperature also plays an important role in producing smooth marshmallows by reducing the time window for ordered crystals to form. To ensure the sugars are disordered, the sugar syrup solution is heated to a high temperature and then cooled rapidly.\n\nSugarcane and sugar beet\nSugarcane and sugar beet are the two primary sources of sugar, consisting of sucrose molecules. Sucrose is a disaccharide that consists of one glucose and fructose molecule. This sugar provides sweetness and bulk to the marshmallow, while simultaneously setting the foam to a firm consistency as it cools. Sucrose, and sugars in general, impair the ability of a foam to form, but improve foam stability. Therefore, sucrose is used in conjunction with a protein like gelatin. The protein can adsorb, unfold, and form a stable network, while the sugar can increase the viscosity. Liquid drainage of the continuous phase must be minimized as well. Thick liquids drain more slowly than thin ones, and so increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase will reduce drainage. A high viscosity is essential if a stable foam is to be produced. Therefore, sucrose is a main component of marshmallow. But sucrose is seldom used on its own, because of its tendency to crystallize.\n\nCorn syrup\nCorn syrup, derived from maize, contains glucose, maltose, and other oligosaccharides. Corn syrup can be obtained from the partial hydrolysis of cornstarch. Corn syrup is important in the production of marshmallow because it prevents the crystallization of other sugars (like sucrose). It may also contribute body, reduce sweetness, and alter flavor release, depending on the Dextrose Equivalent (DE) of the glucose syrup used.\nThe DE is the measure of the amount of reducing sugars present in a sugar product in relation to glucose. Lower-DE glucose syrups will provide a chewier texture, while higher-DE syrups will make the product more tender. In addition, depending on the type of DE used, can alter the sweetness, hygroscopicity, and browning of the marshmallow. Corn syrup is flavorless and cheap to produce which is why candy companies love using this product.\n\nInvert sugar\nInvert sugar is produced when sucrose breaks down due to the addition of water, also known as hydrolysis. This molecule exhibits all the characteristics of honey except the flavor because it is the primary sugar found in honey. This means that invert sugar has the ability to prevent crystallization, and produce a tender marshmallow. It is also an effective humectant, which allows it to trap water, and prevent the marshmallow from drying out. For some candies, this is not a good trait to have, but for marshmallows, it is an advantage since it has a high moisture content.\n\nFruit syrups\nWhile not widely used for traditional or commercial recipes, fruit syrups have been proposed as an alternative sugar for marshmallows.\n\nAdditional ingredients\nFlavors\nUnless a variation of the standard marshmallow is being made, vanilla is always used as the flavoring. The vanilla can either be added in extract form, or by infusing the vanilla beans in the sugar syrup during cooking. This is the best technique to get an even distribution of flavor throughout the marshmallow.\n\nAcids\nAcids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, may also be used to increase foam stability. Addition of acid decreases the pH. This reduces the charge on the protein molecules, and brings them closer to their isoelectric point. This results in a stronger, more stable inter-facial film. When added to egg whites, acid prevents excessive aggregation at the interface. However, acid delays foam formation. It may therefore be added toward the end of the whipping process after a stable foam has been created.\n\nManufacturing process\nCommercial process\nIn commercial marshmallow manufacture, the entire process is streamlined and fully automated.\nGelatin is cooked with sugar and syrup. After the gelatin-containing syrup is cooked, it is allowed to cool slightly before air is incorporated. Whipping is generally accomplished in a rotor-stator type device. Compressed air is injected into the warm syrup, held at a temperature just above the melting point of gelatin. In a marshmallow aerator, pins on a rotating cylinder (rotor) intermesh with stationary pins on the wall (stator) provide the shear forces necessary to break the large injected air bubbles into numerous tiny bubbles that provide the smooth, fine-grained texture of the marshmallow. A continuous stream of light, fluffy marshmallow exits the aerator en route to the forming step.\nThe marshmallow confection is typically formed in one of three ways. First, it can be extruded in the desired shape and cut into pieces, as done for Jet-Puffed marshmallows. Second, it can be deposited onto a belt, as done for Peeps. Third, it can be deposited into a starch-based mold in a mogul to make various shapes.\n\nHome making process\nThe home process for making marshmallow differs from commercial processes. A mixture of corn syrup and sugar is boiled to about 252 \u00b0F (122 \u00b0C). In a separate step, gelatin is hydrated with enough warm water to make a thick solution. Once the sugar syrup has cooled to about 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), the gelatin solution is blended in along with desired flavoring, and whipped in a mixer to reach the final density. The marshmallow is then scooped out of the bowl, slabbed on a table, and cut into pieces.\n\nRoasted marshmallows and s'mores\nA popular camping or backyard tradition in the United Kingdom, North America,  New Zealand and Australia is the roasting or toasting of marshmallows over a campfire or other open flame. A marshmallow is placed on the end of a stick or skewer and held carefully over the fire.  This creates a caramelized outer skin with a liquid, molten layer underneath. Major flavor compounds and color polymers associated with sugar browning are created during the caramelization process.S'mores are a traditional campfire treat in the United States, made by placing a toasted marshmallow on a slab of chocolate, which is placed between two graham crackers. These can then be squeezed together, causing the chocolate to begin melting.\n\nNutrition\nMarshmallows are defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.\n\nDietary preferences\nThe traditional marshmallow recipe uses powdered marshmallow root, but most commercially manufactured marshmallows instead use gelatin in their manufacture. Vegans and vegetarians avoid gelatin, but there are versions which use a substitute non-animal gelling agent such as agar. In addition, marshmallows are generally not considered to be kosher or halal unless either their gelatin is derived from kosher or halal animals or they are vegan.Marshmallow creme and other less firm marshmallow products generally contain little or no gelatin, which mainly serves to allow the familiar marshmallow confection to retain its shape. They generally use egg whites instead. Non-gelatin, egg-containing versions of this product may be consumed by ovo vegetarians. Several brands of vegetarian and vegan marshmallows and marshmallow fluff exist.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Marshmallow Explained at HowStuffWorks.com", "pages": ["Agar", "Althaea (plant)", "Althaea officinalis", "American English", "Ancient Egyptians", "Belgian cuisine", "British English", "Bubble gum", "Campfire", "Camping", "Candy", "Caramelization", "Caramels", "Chewing gum", "Chocolate", "Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats", "Chocolate bar", "Chocolate mousse", "Chocolate truffle", "Chocolaterie", "Chubby Bunny", "Collagen", "Common Era", "Compound chocolate", "Confectionery", "Corn starch", "Corn syrup", "Cornstarch", "Cough sweets", "Couverture chocolate", "Cross-link", "Dispersion (chemistry)", "Divinity (confectionery)", "Doi (identifier)", "Doumak", "Drag\u00e9e", "Egg white", "Flump (sweet)", "Foam", "Food and Nutrition Service", "Food coloring", "Fruit syrups", "Fudge", "Functional chewing gum", "Gelatin", "Glucose", "Graham cracker", "Gum industry", "Halal", "Hard candy", "Horehound drops", "HowStuffWorks.com", "Humectant", "Hydrophile", "Hydrophobe", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "Inverted sugar syrup", "Isoelectric point", "Jelly bean", "Jet-Puffed Marshmallows", "John C.

It is named for its calabash-like shape. Tanghulu is called Tang dun er (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u58a9\u513f) in Tianjin, Tang qiu (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u7403) in Fengyang, Anhui, Tang zhan er (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u8638\u513f) in Shandong. Tanghulu is often mistaken for regular candied fruits; however, it is coated in a hardened sugar syrup. This sweet and sour treat has been made since the Song Dynasty, and it remains popular throughout northern China.Chinese hawthorn is the traditional fruit used for the skewering of fruit, but in ancient times, vendors have also used various other fruits.For example, in records from the Qing Dynasty, grapes and walnuts were added.(\u300a\u71d5\u4eac\u5c81\u65f6\u8bb0\u300b\uff1a\u51b0\u7cd6\u846b\u82a6\uff0c\u4e43\u7528\u7af9\u7b7e\uff0c\u8d2f\u4ee5\u5c71\u91cc\u7ea2\u3001\u6d77\u68e0\u679c\u3001\u8461\u8404\u3001\u9ebb\u5c71\u836f\u3001\u6838\u6843\u4ec1\u3001\u8c46\u6c99\u7b49\uff0c\u8638\u4ee5\u51b0\u7cd6\uff0c\u751c\u8106\u800c\u51c9\u3002) In modern times, fruit choices have become more diverse, such as cherry tomatoes, mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, kiwifruit, or bananas. The pits and seeds of the hawthorn are emptied out and are commonly filled with sweet red bean paste before being skewered and dipped.\n\nOrigin\nDuring the Southern Song Dynasty, the emperor Song Guangzong (simplified Chinese: \u5b8b\u5149\u5b97) had a very beloved Imperial concubine named Huang Guifei. One day, when Huang was sick, she refused to eat or drink all day long, and she seemed about to die at any moment. Palace doctors were puzzled as to how to cure her, resulting in Song Guangzong spending an exorbitant amount of money seeking medical help. Later, a doctor came to the palace and treated Huang. He ordered cooks to prepare the hawthorn with rock sugar, advising Huang to take five to ten of them before each meal. Surprisingly, after a few days, Huang gradually recovered. Everyone thought this method was quite novel, so the prescription was passed down. Later, people began to string the fruit together and sell it on the street, which is now known as tanghulu.\n\nNutrition\nTanghulu is rich in Vitamin C, pectin and chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, quercetin, ursolic acid, chrysin, epicatechin and other organic acids and nutritional elements. The Chinese Hawthorn may have medicinal effects, such as reducing the effects of constipation and dysentery and lowering blood lipids and cholesterol, and its medicinal properties have been widely proven in Chinese Medicine books. However, due to its high sugar content, long-term consumption may be unsuitable for diabetics or people with other health conditions.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCandy apple\nRock candy\nLigao Tang\nList of Chinese desserts\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Tanghulu at Wikimedia Commons", "pages": ["Anhui", "Bamboo", "Banana", "Blood lipids", "Blueberry", "Caffeic acid", "Calabash", "Calorie", "Candy apple", "Cherry tomato", "China", "Chinese New Year", "Chinese hawthorn", "Chlorogenic acid", "Cholesterol", "Chrysin", "Cities in China", "Confections", "Crataegus pinnatifida", "Dysentery", "Emperor Guangzong of Song", "Fengyang County", "Food energy", "ISBN (identifier)", "Kilojoule", "Kiwifruit", "Ligao Tang", "List of Chinese desserts", "Mandarin orange", "Maslinic acid", "Oleanolic acid", "Organic acid", "Pectin", "Pineapple", "Pinyin", "Quercetin", "Quezon City", "Red bean paste", "Rock candy", "Rock sugar", "Shandong", "Simplified Chinese characters", "Skewer", "Song dynasty", "Strawberry", "Syrup", "Tianjin", "Traditional Chinese characters", "Ursolic acid", "Vitamin C", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Help:IPA/English", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from July 2023"]}, "Category:Grilled skewers": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Category:Skewered foods": {"body": "", "pages": ["Category:Skewered foods"]}, "Category:Smoked food": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Module:Location map/data/Poland": {"body": "Grodziskie (Polish pronunciation: [\u0261r\u0254\u02c8d\u0361\u0291isk\u02b2\u025b]; other names: Gr\u00e4tzer, Grodzisz) is a historical beer style from Poland made from oak-smoked wheat malt with a clear, light golden color, high carbonation, low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma.  The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment it. It was nicknamed \"Polish Champagne\" because of its high carbonation levels and valued as a high-quality beer for special occasions.\nGrodziskie is brewed from wheat malt that has been dried by circulating oak smoke through the grains.  The smokiness of the grain and the mineral profile of the water used to brew the beverage gives the style its characteristic flavor.   Polish breweries historically used locally grown hops and one or two strains of brewer's yeast in its production.   Before packaging, the beer is treated with isinglass to produce a bright, clear appearance.  The beer is packaged before all of the fermentable sugars have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers.  Fermentation continues after packaging, and the carbon dioxide that is produced remains dissolved in the beer, resulting in a very high level of carbonation in the final product.\nThe beer was originally produced by brewers in the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski in the 14th or 15th century.  Strict regulations regarding the quality of the beer were established by the local brewers' guild, and helped it develop a good reputation in the surrounding cities and neighboring countries.  At the peak of its fame, it was exported to 37 countries and was regarded as an exceptionally good beer.  The brewing industry in the town flourished.   After the Second World War, beer production was nationalized, and the beer entered a period of decline under the Communist government of Poland.  By 1993, the last brewery that was producing the style was shut down.  After a period of years when the style was not available from any commercial brewers, several breweries began producing seasonal or year-round recreations of the historic style, spurred by interest in the style from the homebrewing community around the world.\n\nDescription\nGrodziskie is a highly carbonated, low-alcohol beer with a clear, pale yellow to golden color, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a moderate to medium-high smoky aroma and flavor.  The bright, clear, and highly carbonated appearance of Grodziskie has caused the beer to be compared with Champagne, and it is sometimes referred to as \"Polish Champagne\". Most beers that are made from wheat appear cloudy, because the final product contains suspended yeast and proteins from the wheat.   During the production of Grodziskie, however, the beer is filtered before it is bottled, usually by adding isinglass.  The filtration removes the suspended yeast and proteins, leaving a bright, clear beer.  When poured into a glass, it produces a large, long-lasting, tight head with small bubbles.  It was traditionally served in tall, conical glasses that were designed to show off the clear, golden color, as well allow a wide, thick layer of foam to form when it was poured.The taste is light and crisp, with some bite from the carbonation.  Brewing and tasting notes from a 1914 publication described Grodziskie as a \"rough, bitter beer ... with an intense smoke and hop flavor\", but by the late 20th century, the style's flavor had likely evolved to include less hop flavor and bitterness.  Modern recreations of this style tend to focus on smoky flavor resulting from the oak-smoked malt, described as \"somewhat acrid to semi-sweet\", but literature from the 1960s states that a significant proportion of the beer's unique flavors are produced by its malting and brewing process and special strains of brewer's yeast that were used in its production.  The flavor may also contain a mild wheat graininess noticeable in the background.Historically, Grodziskie was made with alcohol levels of around 3.1% abv, but commercial versions were also made with alcohol levels ranging from 2.5% to 5% abv.\n\nIngredients\nThe grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat.   During the malting process, the wheat is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning furnaces.   Instead of using the furnaces to heat clean air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed.  The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor.  This  process would not be possible in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors.   The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak kilning in historical times is not known.  The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content.  One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II.  The beer was opened and found to be as fresh as the day it was made.   In addition to wheat, there were periods when the beer also included malted barley in various proportions, but for most of its history, it was made entirely from wheat.Many of the flavor characteristics of Grodziskie result from the chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer.   The water from one of the wells on Pozna\u0144ska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm.Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm.   Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions.   During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during mashing.  The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content.   Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.Two unique strains of yeast were traditionally used; one highly flocculent strain that was responsible for most of the fermentation in the first few days, and the other, a powdery and less flocculant strain, that was slower and finished off the beer in the fermentation vats and in the bottles.  Until the end of the 19th century, the breweries that produced Grodziskie used a single strain of yeast that was characterized by low attenuation and early flocculation.  However, that strain was lost in the early 20th century.  After World War II, yeast was imported from the Groterjan Brewery in Berlin. That  yeast was not well suited for producing Grodziskie and was frequently contaminated with spoilage organisms including Lactobacillus.  In the 1960s, the state-owned brewery was able to isolate and maintain suitable strains of yeast that produced the desired characteristics, but only the highly-flocculant strain has been preserved to this day.  Without access to the actual yeast used historically, most modern recreations of Grodziskie typically use ale yeasts that do not contribute a significant amount of yeast character to the beer.Brewers typically used locally produced varieties of Polish hops such as Nowotomyski, but would occasionally substitute similar noble hops.  Historical sources indicate that around the end of the 19th century, breweries used 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) of hops for every 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wheat malt, but by the 1960s the hopping rate had decreased to 2.4 kilograms (5.3 lb) of hops per 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wheat malt.\n\nProduction\nThe beer was variously produced using an infusion mash or a decoction mash.  Some of the traditional production methods of the style are known from undated records from the Grodzisk brewery.    These records describe an infusion mash that included a 30-minute acid rest at 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), a 30 to 60 minute protease rest at 52 \u00b0C (126 \u00b0F), an \u03b1-amylase rest for 30 minutes at 70 \u00b0C (158 \u00b0F), and a mash out at 75 \u00b0C (167 \u00b0F).   The wort was boiled for 90 to 120 minutes.  Approximately 80% of the hops were added after 15 minutes and the remaining 20% were added 30 minutes before the end of the boil.After the boil, the wort was cooled and fermented in open wooden vats at 14\u201316 \u00b0C (57\u201361 \u00b0F).  The two strains of yeast were added at the same time, and fermentation would proceed rapidly.  After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed on the top of the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse.  The beer was then pumped with sterile air into clarification tanks.  Isinglass was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.After packaging, the bottles were stored from three to five weeks at 14\u201318 \u00b0C (57\u201364 \u00b0F) in a dark room as the yeast continued to ferment the remaining sugars in the beer.  The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in the bottles and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of carbonation.  During this period, an average of four to five percent of the bottles would burst due to carbonation levels exceeding the strength of the bottles.\n\nHistory\nThe first documented mention of the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski was from around 1257 as part of lands owned by the Cistercian monastery in Parady\u017c. The town grew in prominence due to its location on the road between Pozna\u0144 and Gubin, a road that continued onward to Saxony. By the 16th century, the Ostror\u00f3g family in Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) controlled the town. The Ostror\u00f3g family was a source of support for the Protestant Reformation in the area, and the town became a center of Protestantism in the country and attracted dissidents from the Czech lands and Western Europe. Craftsmen, scholars, and writers gravitated to the area, which became a center of reformist thought in Wielkopolska. Industrial-scale brewing developed when Johann Volanus, the administrator of the Ostror\u00f3g estate and father of Andreas Volanus, a famous Reformation writer, imported skilled brewers from Moravia and Bohemia.A legend associated with the history of this beer relates to the Benedictine monk named Bernard of W\u0105brze\u017ano. Around 1603, he arrived from the Benedictine monastery in Lubi\u0144 to find the residents starving and the town's wells depleted. The brewery was the primary source of income for the city and the hospital. Bernard prayed for the wells and a new source of water suddenly filled the Old Market well. Legends claimed that the newly refilled well had the ability to make whoever drank from it healthy again, and the beer that was produced from the water was far superior to any of the beer the brewers had been able to produce before. The well became a municipal treasure and was given credit for the commercial success of the breweries over the centuries to follow. For over 200 years after the event, the residents of Grodzisk would make an annual procession to Bernard's monastery to bring a keg of the beer that they made from the well as a show of gratitude.\nA maltsters' and brewers' guild existed in the town in 1601. The guild created a monopoly on the right to produce malted grain and beer for sale, and kept it in the hands of a select few families, strictly controlled by the guilds. It also implemented rules and regulations on the production of the beer that was designed to protect the quality and reputation of the beer. A system of quality control was put in place; each barrel of beer that was produced was subjected to a beer tasting by the mayor of the town and a council of elders who evaluated its quality and strength and approved the beer for sale or export with a distinctive stamp. Brewers who attempted to cheat the system of quality control were permanently stripped of their right to produce the beer. The guild also organized the production of beer by the major breweries, which shared the Old Market well. In 1843 and 1844, there were two breweries in Grodzisk that shared the well. By 1866, the city had begun taxing the breweries for their use of the municipal wells. Two private breweries built their own wells, and found that the water was just as good as the water from the Old Market. Following this discovery, all of breweries eventually built their own wells.The earliest documentation of the beer being exported to other regions is from records in the nearby town of Wschowa from 1671. Rules established by the local hatters' guild established that the penalty for charging less than 12 groschen for dying a hat was a barrel of Grodziskie. In 1694, the nearby city of Pozna\u0144 listed a bill for expenses that included entries for \"Grodzisk beer\" at the rate of 15 guilders per barrel that had been purchased as gifts for important people. At that cost, it can be seen that the product was valued as a premium beverage, since local beer produced in Pozna\u0144 at the time cost only five to six guilders per barrel. Other records from Pozna\u0144 in 1712 show that the two mayors of the city were receiving Grodziskie beer as a portion of their compensation for their service. By the 18th century, the beverage's reputation had spread throughout Poland, and it became one of the most expensive beers in the country.Between 1793, when Grodzisk became part of Prussia as a result of the Second Partition of Poland, and 1918, when it became part of a newly independent Poland, the town was renamed Gr\u00e4tz, and the style became known as Gr\u00e4tzer. Records show that annual production of the beer in Gr\u00e4tz was about 3,200 barrels (5,000 hectoliters, 4,300 U.S. bbl), of which 1,111 barrels were transported to Pozna\u0144, 1,581 barrels to other nearby towns, including Wschowa, Ko\u015bcian, Leszno, Rawicz, Bojanowo, Kalisz, and \u015amigiel, and 500 barrels were sold within Gr\u00e4tz. In the late 19th century, the beer was being exported into neighboring provinces and other parts of Germany. German immigrants moved to Gr\u00e4tz and built modern breweries, breaking the monopoly that had been held by the brewer's guild. By the 1890s, the five breweries in Gr\u00e4tz produced over 100,000 hectoliters (85,000 U.S. bbl) of beer, with Gr\u00e4tzer produced in the largest quantities. It was exported to other parts of Europe and the world and gained fame as a highly valued beverage. Its peak of popularity occurred just prior to the second World War, when it was being exported to 37 countries.\nStarting in 1922, the production of Grodziskie was continued by only one company, Zjednoczone Browary Grodziskie (United Grodzisk Breweries). Between 1929 and 1993, this style had a regionally protected designation put in place by the cabinet of Poland. Production continued under the German occupation of Poland during World War II, and the beer was distributed to German forces fighting in the war. After the Second World War, the breweries were nationalized, and the beer began a period of decline. The communist government in Poland emphasized the large-scale production of basic products like bread, milk, and sugar, and local culinary traditions were neglected. In part, this was due to restrictions on individual businesses and the inability of brewers to profit from the production of small-scale, high-quality foods, and their inability to advertise local goods and specialties. In the early 1980s, different variations of the style were created with different colors and alcohol strengths. After the Communist period in Poland ended in 1989, production continued under the private ownership of Lech Browary Wielkopolski, but ended in 1993, when the brewery was closed due to lack of profitability, and because of the difficulty in finding workers who had experience producing the style. Commercial production of this style ceased for several years, but since 2010, some breweries have produced seasonal or limited production runs of the style.After the close of the brewery, Grodziskie continued to be brewed by some homebrewers in Poland using 100% smoked wheat. In 2011, the Polish Homebrewers Association formed a commission for the revival of the Grodziskie beer. Even though the style has taken different forms over the years, the purpose of the commission was to develop guidelines that describe a mild version that former brewery workers could identify, even though some brewers and homebrewers have experimented with variations that include different amounts of alcohol and bitterness. Grodziskie was defined in the Brewers Association style guidelines in 2013, and added as a Historical Style to the Beer Judge Certification Program style guidelines in 2015.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBrowar w Grodzisku, a brewery in Grodzisk Wielkopolski, opened in 2015\nGrodziskie Redivivus at the Polish Home Brewers' Association (in Polish)", "pages": ["Abbey beers", "Adjuncts", "Alcohol by volume", "Ale", "Alkalinity", "Altbier", "Amber ale", "American lager", "American pale ale", "American wild ale", "Andreas Volanus", "Australian lager", "Australian pale ale", "Baltic porter", "Banana beer", "Barley", "Barley wine", "Barrel-aged beer", "Beer Judge Certification Program", "Beer and breweries by region", "Beer head", "Beer in Poland", "Beer sommelier", "Beer style", "Benedictine", "Berliner Weisse", "Bernard of W\u0105brze\u017ano", "Bitter (beer)", "Bi\u00e8re de Garde", "Bock", "Bojanowo", "Brewers Association", "Brewery", "Brewing", "Brown ale", "Burton ale", "Cabinet of Poland", "Carbonation", "Champagne", "Chloride", "Cistercian", "Coal", "Coke (fuel)", "Communist Party of Poland", "Copper ale", "Corn beer", "Cream ale", "Czech lands", "Decoction", "Doi (identifier)", "Dortmunder Export", "Dubbel", "Duchy of Saxony", "Dunkel", "Farmhouse ale", "Fermentation", "Flanders red ale", "Framboise", "Fruit beer", "Gose", "Go\u015bcikowo", "Grisette (beer)", "Grodzisk Wielkopolski", "Groschen", "Gubin, Poland", "Gueuze", "Hard soda", "Helles", "Homebrewing", "Hops", "Ice beer", "India pale ale", "Infusion", "Irish red ale", "Isinglass", "Kalisz", "Kellerbier", "Kentucky common beer", "Kingdom of Bohemia", "Ko\u015bcian", "Kriek lambic", "Kvass", "K\u00f6lsch (beer)", "Lactobacillus", "Lager", "Lambic", "Lech Browary Wielkopolski", "Leszno", "Light beer", "List of beer styles", "Low-alcohol beer", "Lubi\u0144, Ko\u015bcian County", "Magnesium", "Malt beer", "Malting", "Margraviate of Moravia", "Mashing", "Mild ale", "Millet beer", "M\u00e4rzen", "Nowotomyski hops", "Old ale", "Ostror\u00f3g family", "Oud bruin", "PH", "PMID (identifier)", "Pale ale", "Pale lager", "Parts-per notation", "Pilsner", "Pito (beer)", "Podpiwek", "Poland", "Porter (beer)", "Pozna\u0144", "Protestant Reformation", "Prussia", "Pumpkin ale", "Quadrupel", "Rawicz", "Real ale", "Revolutions of 1989", "Rye beer", "Sahti", "Saison", "Schwarzbier", "Scotch ale", "Seasonal beer", "Second Partition of Poland", "Second Polish Republic", "Small beer", "Smoked beer", "Sour beer", "Spruce beer", "Steam beer", "Stout", "Strong ale", "Sulfate", "Tella", "Top-fermenting", "Trappist beer", "Tripel", "Wheat beer", "Wheat beers", "Wielkopolska", "World War II", "Wschowa", "Yeast", "Yeast flocculation", "Zoigl", "\u015amigiel", "Wikipedia:Good articles*", "Wikipedia:Link rot", "File:Poland-CIA WFB Map.png", "Template:Beer styles", "Template talk:Beer styles", "Help:IPA/Polish", "Category:Articles with dead external links from October 2017", "Category:Use dmy dates from June 2022", "Portal:Beer", "Portal:Drink", "Module:Location map/data/Poland"]}, "Portal:Middle East": {"body": "Jallab or Jellab (Arabic: \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0628 / ALA-LC: jall\u0101b) is a type of fruit syrup popular in the Middle East made from carob, dates, grape molasses and rose water.\nJallab is very popular in Palestine, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt.

wood smoke while retaining a similar flavor. It can be used to flavor any meat or vegetable. It is available as pure condensed smoke from various types of wood, and as derivative formulas containing additives.\n\nHistory\nPyrolysis or thermal decomposition of wood in a low oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal. Condensates of the vapors eventually were made and found useful as preservatives. For centuries, water-based condensates of wood smoke were popularly called \"wood vinegar\", presumably due to its use as food vinegar. Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. In 1658, Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined the methods to produce wood vinegar during charcoal making. Further, he described the use of the water insoluble tar fraction as a wood preservative and documented the freezing of the wood vinegar to concentrate it. Use of the term \"pyroligneous acid\" for wood vinegar emerged by 1788.\nIn the United States, in 1895, E. H. Wright inaugurated the era of commercial distribution of pyroligneous acid under a new name, liquid smoke. Among Wright's innovations were the standardization of the product, marketing and distribution. Wright's Liquid Smoke, since 1997 owned by B&G Foods, and its modern-day successors have always been the subject of controversy about their contents and production, but in 1913, Wright prevailed in a federal misbranding case. Case judge Van Valkenburg wrote:\n The Government, in trying to show that this is not smoke produced by combustion, has shown that it is produced in exactly the same kind of way that is stated on that label. The fact is that they have produced something here which they say has something of the flavor and properties similar to the curative properties of smoke; they get it out of wood and they get it by distillation and it turns out to be a substance like, if not exactly identical with pyroligneous acid. Well, nobody could be deceived into thinking it was specifically what the indictment charges they are being deceived with. It is a thing which is produced in such a manner from the art and methods employed in it, that the application of the term \"smoke\" to it seems to me to be apt or applicable instead of deceptive, and it does not deceive in the sense this statute implies.\nHistorically, all pyroligneous acid products, Wright's product and many other condensates have been made as byproducts of charcoal manufacturing, which was of greater value. Chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid and acetone have been isolated from these condensates and sold. With the advent of lower cost fossil fuel sources, today these and other wood derived chemicals retain only small niches. Today there are many manufacturing locations around the world, most of which pyrolyze wood primarily to generate condensates which are further processed to make hundreds of derivative products. These are now referred to less as liquid smoke products, and instead as smoke flavorings, smoke flavors, and natural condensed smoke.\n\nProduction\nThe condensed products from the destructive distillation of wood are called \"liquid smoke\" or \"pyroligneous acid\". There are no standards of identity, prescribed production methods, or tests which distinguish between liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid; they can be considered to be the same. However, the numerous variables that are manipulated during pyrolysis do lead to a wide range of compositions of the condensates. In addition, implementation of many further processing steps by concentration, dilution, distillation, extraction, and use of food additives has led to the many hundreds of different products on the market worldwide.\nWood, particularly hardwood, is by far the most widely used biomass pyrolyzed to make liquid smoke. Commercial products are made using both batch and continuous methods. Commercial products are made using a range of reactors from rotary calciners, heated screws, batch charcoal kilns, to fast pyrolysis reactors. The process type and conditions of processing lead to greater variances between the condensates than the differences between the common wood types that are in use. Variables such as feed rate, vapor residence time, particle size, oxygen infiltration, and temperature can have substantial effects on yield and composition of the condensates. Wide ranges of chemical composition are reported throughout the literature and unless the process and conditions are cited, there is limited utility of such results. Commercial manufacturers strive to control their manufacturing variables in order to standardize product compositions.\nWater is added either during condensation or after to cause separation of three fractions. Once water is added, the aqueous phase becomes the largest and most useful fraction. It contains wood-derived chemical compounds of higher chemical polarity such as those found in carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and phenol chemical classes. Many compounds together are responsible for the flavor, browning, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects of smoke and liquid smoke. The smallest condensed fraction is the lowest-polarity upper phase which a mix of phytosterols and other oily, waxy substances. The lower phase is commonly referred to as tar. It is an intermediate-polarity mixture of phenolic polymers, secondary and tertiary reaction products, some of the water-soluble polar compounds partitioned in the amount of which is governed by individual partition coefficients, water and the bulk of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Wood tar has been used as a preservative, water repellent, and antiseptic. Tar from birch was produced as a commodity product on large scale in northern Europe. Today commercial liquid smoke products are still prepared from this phase.\nLiquid smoke condensates are made commercially for the global meat industry in the U.S. and Europe and are regulated by governments. Liquid smoke is still referred to as wood vinegar, and is made and used indigenously in places including Japan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Southeast Asia.\n\nUse\nFood\nThe application of liquid smoke to food has grown to encompass a wide variety of methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. Liquid smoke is used extensively by topical application to replace direct wood-smoking of food. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright's liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization, which is still the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved, and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines are the usual methods of application. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings is also used; meat products are stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another way to impart smoke flavor, used when other technical functions of smoke do not need to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods, or injecting whole muscle meat. The smoke flavors can also be incorporated into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings. Aqueous smoke solutions can also be extracted into oil, spray-dried using maltodextrin carriers, or plated onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.\n\nNon-food\nExtensive references to beneficial uses of pyroligneous acid in plants for seed germination, pest control, microbial control, plant structural enhancements are reported. Livestock benefits such as antimicrobial preservation of feed, nutrient digestibility, and other claims are found. Scientific agricultural studies can be found in peer-reviewed journals, but many agricultural benefits such as soil quality improvement, better seed germination, and healthier foliage are widely promoted without attribution. Broad claims of medical benefits to humans in digestive ailments, dental infections, liver, heart, skin ailments, ears, eyes are found, but the literature is devoid of accepted scientific studies for such testimonial claims in humans.\n\nSafety\nThe first government-sanctioned assessment of liquid smoke was undertaken by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981. The committee commissioned by the FDA to evaluate information on the products concluded there was no evidence demonstrating the products were a hazard to the public the way they were being used. Today, these products stand as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the United States and may be used at levels necessary to produce the intended technical effects. Manufacturing plants where liquid smoke is made are regulated and inspected by the FDA.\nThe European Union established procedures for the safety assessment and the authorization of smoke flavorings used or intended for use in or on foods in 2003. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was charged with evaluating information on primary condensate smoke flavorings. Information on twelve products from ten applicants were evaluated by EFSA. Opinions were published on all twelve. The products considered were what each applicant considered their own primary product prior to any further processing or derivatization. All twelve products were determined to be genotoxic positive by in vitro methods, but when evaluated by in vivo methods ten were found to not be of concern by EFSA. The AM-01 product was judged inconclusive and FF-B was considered weakly genotoxic. Based upon the NOAEL determinations for each product and supplemental information supplied by some manufacturers, usage limits for most products have been established and are conveyed by manufacturers to users. Most of these primary products and their derivatives remain in commercial use. Only products which are the subjects of these evaluations are authorized to be used in commerce within the EU.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLeffingwell & Associates, Smoke Flavor I.

This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking.\n\nHistory\nThe local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which was used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.\n\nStyle of cooking\nThere are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), \"the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi\" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called Kath tandoors in Punjabi.\n\nStaple foods\nPunjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India. Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet.\nDairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer. Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of Lassi. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter).\n\nFood additives and condiments\nFood additives and condiments are usually added to enhance the flavor of the food. Food coloring as additive is used in sweet dishes and desserts. Starch is used as a bulking agent.\n\nCommon dishes\nBreakfast\nBreakfast recipes with respect to different regions within Punjab varies. Common ones are chana masala, nan, chole kulche, aloo paratha, paneer paratha, gobi paratha, paratha with curd, paratha with butter, halwa poori, bhatoora, falooda, makhni doodh, Amritsari lassi, masala chai, tea, Amritsari kulchas, dahi vada, dahi, khoa, paya, aloo paratha with butter, panjeeri with milk.\nIn the upper Punjab Pakistan the Lahori Katlama is famous for breakfast as well.\n\nMeat\nPoultry, lamb and goat meat are the preferred meat sources in different regions of Punjab.\nMany dishes of meat variety is available and some of them are named below.\n\nBiryani: lamb, chicken, and beef\nPilaf: Beef and Lamb\nKebab: braised chicken, beef, or lamb meat, commonly served with naan and flat bread.\nKeema: Braised minced lamb meat, commonly served with naan.\nLamb: including rogan josh, Bhuna Gosht, Kadhai Gosht, Raan Gosht, Dal Gosht, Saag Gosht, Nihari, Rara Gosht, Paye da Shorba\nShami kebab, chicken karahi, Amritsari tandoori chicken, Punjabi Karhi (the chicken yogurt curry of Punjab), Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni), chicken tikka, Paye.\nKunna Gosht, slow cooked meat prepared in Kunna (mitti ki bartan (clay utensil))\nHaleem is made of meat (beef or chicken) slow cooked with a mixture of legumes softened by overnight cooking it is a protein rich food with spices and aromatics like nutmeg served with wedge of lemon and saut\u00e9ed onions.\n\nFish\nSince Punjab is a landlocked region, freshwater fish, and not marine fish, forms an important part of the cuisine. Carp, rohu and catfish are the most commonly prepared fish. Other fish types include thela machi and tilapia. Recently shrimp has been introduced. Fish tikka is an Amritsari speciality.\n\nVegetarian\nKhichdi, a grain-and-lentil dish: In the Punjab, khichdi is made of millet flour, mung beans and moth lentils (Vigna aconitifolia). However, khichdi made of rice and red lentils or mung beans is also consumed.\nRajma, Rajma is the Hindi word for Red kidney beans. Beans are cooked on medium spicy onion-tomato gravy and most often served with steamed rice and sometimes with Indian flatbread called Chapati (Phulka in Punjab region).\nPaneer (freshly made cottage cheese) Recipes like Shahi Paneer; Khoya Paneer, Paneer Kofta (paneer chunks battered and fried, then simmered in a spicy gravy), Amritsari Paneer, Matar Paneer (paneer with green peas), paneer paratha (wheat flatbread stuffed with paneer),Palak Paneer\nPanjiri: This is a traditional North Indian dessert and is popular in Punjab region as well. which has a generous amount of almonds, walnuts, pistachios, dry dates, cashew nuts along with whole wheat flour, sugar, edible gum, poppy seeds and fennel seeds to make the traditional dish of 'panjri' or also known as 'dabra'.\nLegumes: a variety of legumes are used, including chickpeas, pigeon peas, red lentils, mung bean, red kidney beans (originally an import from the Americas) and black gram. Legumes may be used singly or in combination like Dal Makhani\nSaag: a variety of leafy greens (including spinach and mustard greens), typically cooked down to a stew, tempered with ginger, tomato, onion, garlic, chilies and other spices, and often enriched with paneer or cream. Bathua is also added to enhance the flavor. It is served with butter on top and with makki ki roti. Saag is a winter and spring delicacy; it is one of the most popular dishes of Punjab.\nEggplant: Baingan bharta is similar to baba ghanoush in the way the eggplant is prepared by roasting and peeling the skin off, but much richer, with the incorporation of much cooked tomato, browned onion and a variety of spices instead of tahini.\nPunj Ratani Dal: A thick gravy that uses 5 legumes, with tomato, browned onion and spices.\nPunjabi Kadhi Pakora (traditional curry with rice). Kadhi is a type of curry made with yogurt or buttermilk, which is thickened with chickpea flour and seasoned with ginger, turmeric, chilies, and tempered spices. Deep-fried lumps of spiced chickpea-flour batter (pakoras) are also added.\nPunjabi Lassi paneer: In the Punjab, it is traditional to prepare lassi and then extract the paneer which would then be consumed by adding water, salt and chili. Lassi paneer can also be added to potatoes and spices to make a curry which resembles scrambled eggs. Lassi paneer cannot be cut into cubes as paneer from milk can be.\n\nSnacks\nToasted grains: In Punjab, toasting corn and wheat grains on the Punjabi bhathi is a traditional snack preparation.\nSamosas\nGolgappa\n\nRaita and chutney\nAlong with all types of main dishes raita or chutney is also served.\n\nSweets and desserts\nPunjabi cuisine includes various types of desserts and Mithyai which include:\n\nAmritsari\nKheer, dessert made of rice milk and dry fruits\nKhoya\nKulfi, an ice-cream-like dessert\nMalpua\nRabri\nSemolina-based desserts: Halva\nSheer korma\nKaju katli\nAtte ka halwa (Kadah)\nPude - usually made during the rainy season\nPinni - Made with desi ghee, wheat flour, almond and jaggery\nGulab jamun\nJalebi\nBurfi.\n\nBread\nPunjabis eat a variety of breads. Flatbreads and raised breads are eaten on a daily basis. Raised breads are known as khamiri roti. Sunflower and flax seeds are also added in some breads occasionally. The breads may be made of different types of flour and can be made in various ways:\n\nBaked in the tandoor like naan, tandoori roti, kulcha, or lachha paratha\nDry baked (Indian griddle), jowar di roti, baajre di roti and makki di roti (these are also smeared with white butter)\nShallow fried like paratha\nDeep fried like puri, Kachori and bhatoora (a fermented dough)\nSalt-rising bread: Salt-rising bread is a unique bread found only in the Salt Range region of Punjab, Pakistan. Since rock salt is readily available in the salt range, many people in the past made use of salt instead of yeast to leaven the bread.\nPapar\n Taftan: an Iranian bread very popular in Pakistan and Lahore. It can be eaten with korma and nihari.\n\nHerbs and spices\nIndian subcontinent-based spices are used in Punjabi cuisine, which are ground in a mortar and pestle or a food processor.\n\nBeverages\nPunjab has a diverse range of beverages. Some are dairy-based such as lassi and buttermilk. Water buffalo milk-based products are especially common around Punjab. Examples are mango lassi, mango milkshake, and chaas. Others are juices derived from vegetables and fruits, such as watermelon shakes, carrot juice and tamarind juice (imli ka paani). Shikanjvi and neembu paani drinks are especially preferred during the summer. Jal-jeera is also common as well.\nSattu is a traditional North Indian drink that is also traditionally consumed in the Punjab. Sattu is made by roasting barley grains and then grinding them into powder, mixed with salt and turmeric and water.The local regional drinks in Punjab also include Doodh soda (milk soda), Desi Daaru (a local form of alcohol in India) and Bantay (a local soda drink) in Pakistan.\n\nFermented foods\nFermented foods are common in Punjabi cuisine. Also fermented foods are added in the preparation of some dishes as well. Mango pickle is especially famous in many villages of Punjab.\n\nCooking methods\nTraditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include:\n\nChullah\nThe traditional name of the stove in the Punjabi language is chulla. Traditional houses also have ovens (wadda chulla or band chulla) that are made from bricks, stones, and in many cases clay. Older communities in Punjab also used earth ovens (khadda chulla), but this tradition is dying out now.\n\nBhathi\nA masonry oven is known as a bhathi. Outdoor cooking and grilling have many different types of bhathi. A bhathi is used to roast wheat or corn for which Kalsi (1992) describes as a \"special oven with an open pan in which sand is heated to roast corn.\"\n\nHara\nA hara is a six-foot-tall oven with its own roof. The hara is traditionally used to slow-heat milk or slow-cook pulses such as chickpeas.\n\nTandoor\nAccording to Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History by Mukhtar Ahmed, Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Roy Hayter the original versions of the tandoor \"in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground\". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.\n\nModern methods\nPressure cookers\nIron griddle\n\nEtiquette of Punjabi dining\nEtiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families.\nBringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.\n\nMajor features of etiquette\nAn invitation to a meal or tea is typically distributed few days beforehand. Denying the invitation for no major reason is considered a breach of etiquette.\nTable setting is done before the arrival of the guests.\nFamily members or any occupants within one home make sure to eat together during the dinner. If any other person is present in the vicinity, then they are offered meals as a way of giving respect. It is considered rude to start eating food without asking others to participate in a meal. It is customary to offer food to anyone in your vicinity before eating. The invited guest or elder person is given special respect and attention. Usually the invited guest is requested to start the meal. It is considered rude if the host starts eating without taking into account the attendance of all guests.\nPunjabi families use a hybrid style of South Asian and European utensil etiquette most of the times. The bread and rice are eaten with the hands. Desserts are eaten with spoons. Soup spoons are used for consuming soup and forks are used for eating noodles. Chewing food with one's mouth open and burping in front of others is considered rude. In the villages of Punjab, an additional common plate is usually placed on the table for any bones left from the consumption of bone meat. Placing leftovers on the floor or on the table floor is considered bad etiquette.\n\nPunjabi dhaba\nThe roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers. They can also be a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of the greasy spoon.\n\nPunjabi Restaurants\nPunjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946 and is the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world's first Punjabi restaurant to earn One Michelin Star in 2019.\n\nSee also\nIndian cuisine\nPakistani cuisine\nLahori

"Portal:Beer": {"body": "Smoked beer (German: Rauchbier) is a type of beer with a distinctive smoke flavour imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame.\n\nHistory\nDrying malt over an open flame in a smoke kiln may impart a smoky character to the malt.  This character may carry over to beers brewed with the smoked malt. Before the modern era, drying malted barley in direct sunlight was used in addition to drying over flames. Even though hot air kiln drying of malt, using indirect heat, did not enter into widespread usage until the industrial era, the method was known as early as the first century BC. Also, there have been various methods over the years of preparing cereal grains for brewing, including making beer from bread, so smoked beer was not universal.\nBeginning in the 18th century, hot air kiln drying of malt became progressively more common and, by the mid-19th century, had become the near-universal method for drying malted grain. Since the hot air kiln method prevents any smoke from coming into contact with wet malt, a smoky flavour is not imparted to the grain, nor to the subsequent beer. As a result, smoke flavour in beer became less and less common, and eventually disappeared almost entirely from the brewing world.\n\nBamberg Rauchbier\nCertain breweries maintained the smoked beer tradition by continuing to use malt which had been dried over open flames. The malt is dried over fires made from beechwood logs. The malt and fermenting beer are stored under the pub and brewery in a part of the catacombs of Bamberg, a maze of tunnels under the city built from the 11th century onward, which have a very stable moisture and temperature. In former times, ice was used to cool the fermenting beer tank room, the Lagerkeller. This ice was locally harvested above ground in the winter, although when the winter was too mild, ice was imported from as far away as Finland or Sweden. The beer is then filtered to clarify it and remove yeast remnants, and put into oaken vats. Two brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany, Schlenkerla and Spezial, have continued this type of smoked beer production for more than a century. Several varieties of Rauchbier (\"smoked beer\" in German) are produced by these companies. Both are still in operation today, alongside seven other breweries in the same town. Since the rauchbier tradition was continuously preserved in Bamberg, the beer style is now marketed as Bamberg Rauchbier. \nDue to the popularity of craft beer in recent years, smoke-flavoured  industrially-produced malts became available, and so the style has been attempted worldwide, including in its heartland of Franconia and Bamberg. Schlenkerla and Spezial, however, use a traditional, elaborate way of smoke malting. In 2017 Slow Food included these two Rauchbiere in their Ark of Taste.The Brewers Association distinguishes three variations of Bamberg-style Rauchbier: Helles , M\u00e4rzen, and Bock. Each is brewed according to the underlying style, but with smoked malts replacing some or all of the mash bill.\n\nGrodziskie\nGrodziskie or Gr\u00e4tzer are similar, traditional smoked beers from Poland, but made from wheat and highly carbonated, and with a perhaps older history, although they saw a period of no production in the late 1990s.Grodziskie traditionally contain 2.7\u20133.7% alcohol by volume with little to no hop flavor or aroma, and medium-low to medium bitterness. Typical coloration is straw to gold.\n\nSmoked beers outside Germany and Poland\nIn Australia, the Feral Brewing Company and Nail Brewing, both in Western Australia, make a smoked porter.

Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.:\u200a18\u200aCouscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya.:\u200a250\u200a It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century, through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"couscous\" (alternately cuscus or kuskus) was first noted in early 17th century French, from Arabic kuskus, from kaskasa 'to pound', and is probably of Berber origin. The term seksu is attested in various Berber dialects such as Kabyle and Rifain, while Saharan Berber dialects such as Touareg and Ghadames have a slightly different form, keskesu. This widespread geographical dispersion of the term strongly suggests its local Berber origin, lending further support to its likely Berber roots as Algerian linguist Salem Chaker suggests.The Berber root *KS means \"well formed, well rolled, rounded.\" Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world.:\u200a919\n\nHistory\nIt is unclear when couscous originated. Food historian Lucie Bolens believes couscous originated millennia ago, during the reign of Masinissa in the ancient kingdom of Numidia in present-day Algeria. Traces of cooking vessels akin to couscoussiers have been found in graves from the 3rd century BC, from the time of the berber kings of Numidia, in the city of Tiaret, Algeria. Couscoussiers dating back to the 12th century were found in the ruins of Igiliz, located in the Sous valley of Morocco.According to food writer Charles Perry, couscous originated among the Berbers of Algeria and Morocco between the end of the 11th-century Zirid dynasty, modern-day Algeria, and the rise of the 13th-century Almohad Caliphate. The historian Hady Idris noted that couscous is attested to during the Hafsid dynasty, but not the Zirid dynasty.In the 12th century, Maghrebi cooks were preparing dishes of non-mushy grains by stirring flour with water to create light, round balls of couscous dough that could be steamed.The historian Maxime Rodinson found three recipes for couscous from the 13th century Arabic cookbook Kitab al-Wusla ila al-Habib, written by an Ayyubid author, and the anonymous Arabic cooking book Kitab al tabikh and Ibn Razin al-Tujibi's Fadalat al-khiwan also contain recipes.Couscous is believed to have been spread among the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula by the Berber dynasties of the 13th century, though it is no longer found in traditional Spanish or Portuguese cuisine. In modern day Trapani, Sicily, the dish is still made to the medieval recipe of Andalusian author Ibn Razin al-Tujibi. Ligurian families that moved from Tabarka to Sardinia brought the dish with them to Carloforte in the 18th century.Known in France since the 16th century, it was brought into French cuisine at the beginning of the 20th century via the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs.\n\nPreparation\nCouscous is traditionally made from semolina, the hardest part of the grain of durum wheat (the hardest of all forms of wheat), which resists the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished, granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny couscous granules. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of people come together to make large batches over several days, which are then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.In some regions, couscous is made from farina or coarsely ground barley or pearl millet.\n\nIn modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold worldwide. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid. Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty.\nTraditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called a taseksut in the Berber language, a \u0643\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633 kiskas in  Arabic or a couscoussier in  French language). The base is a tall metal pot shaped like an oil jar, where the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The steamer's lid has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth.\nThe couscous that is sold in most Western grocery stores is usually pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous and then leaving it covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice). Packaged sets of quick-preparation couscous and canned vegetables, and generally meat, are routinely sold in European grocery stores and supermarkets. Couscous is widely consumed in France, where it was introduced by Maghreb immigrants and voted the third most popular dish in a 2011 survey.\n\nRecognition\nIn December 2020, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia obtained official recognition for the knowledge, know-how, and practices pertaining to the production and consumption of couscous on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The joint submission by the four countries was hailed as an \"example of international cooperation.\"\n\nLocal variations\nCouscous proper is about 2 mm in diameter, but there also exists a larger variety (3 mm more) known as berkoukes, as well as an ultra-fine version (around 1 mm). In Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, it is generally served with vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and turnips) cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, usually with some meat (generally, chicken, lamb, or mutton).\n\nAlgeria\nAlgerian couscous is a traditional staple food in Algeria, and it plays an important role in Algerian culture and cuisine. It is commonly served with vegetables, meat, or fish. In Algeria, there are various types of couscous dishes.\n\nTunisia\nIn Tunisia, couscous is usually spicy, made with harissa sauce, and served commonly with vegetables and meat, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef, and sometimes (in southern regions) camel. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus, squid or other seafood in a hot, red, spicy sauce.\nCouscous can also be served as a dessert. It is then called Masfuf. Masfuf can also contain raisins, grapes, or pomegranate seeds.\n\nLibya\nIn Libya, couscous is mostly served with lamb (but sometimes camel meat or, rarely, beef) in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey and is locally referred to as maghrood.\n\nMalta\nIn Malta, small round pasta slightly larger than typical couscous is known as kusksu. It is commonly used in a dish of the same name, which includes broad beans (known in Maltese as ful) and \u0121bejniet, a local type of cheese.\n\nMauritania\nIn Mauritania, the couscous uses large wheat grains (mabroum) and is darker than the yellow couscous of Morocco. It is cooked with lamb, beef, or camel meat together with vegetables, primarily onion, tomato, and carrots, then mixed with a sauce and served with ghee, locally known as dhen.\n\nSimilar foods\nCouscous is made from crushed wheat flour rolled into its constituent granules or pearls, making it distinct from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, which is made from ground wheat and either molded or extruded. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined.Several dishes worldwide are also made from granules, like those of couscous rolled from flour from grains or other milled or grated starchy crops.\n\nAtti\u00e9k\u00e9, a staple food in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and surrounding regions of West Africa, is made from granulated grated cassava.\nCuscuz (Portuguese pronunciation: [kus\u02c8kus]) is a couscous-like dish from the Northeast Region of Brazil. It is made out of cornmeal and eaten hot with meat and cold with milk. In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo the cuscuz is pressed into a mold decorated with orange slices, in a dish called \"cuscuz Paulista,\" a variation of the original version made by locals after migrant waves from the Northeast Region.\nDambou is a couscous-like dish from Niger. It may be made from semolina for special occasions but is often made with rice, millet, or other grain. Moringa leaves are traditionally included in the dish. In France, this Nigerien dish has been adapted as a specific variant (called couscous aux \u00e9pinards) of the Maghreb-syle couscous commonly found there, often using spinach in place of the moringa.\nFregula is a type of pasta from Sardinia. It is similar to North African Berkoukes and Middle Eastern Moghrabieh. Fregula comes in varying sizes but typically consists of semolina dough rolled into balls 2\u20133 mm in diameter and toasted in an oven.\nKouskousaki (\u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (in Greek) or kuskus (in  Turkish) is a pasta from Greece and Turkey, that is boiled and served with cheese and walnuts.In the Levant, the dish known as moghrabieh (a reference to the Maghreb region) uses the same durum-based semolina flour but rolled into larger (5\u20136 millimetres (0.20\u20130.24 in) in diameter) 'pearls' to create a dish that is popular across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The pearls are either cooked as part of a stew or flavored with cinnamon and served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth.\nPalestinian maftoul uses granules that are larger than the North African variety but smaller than moghrabieh pearls (2\u20133 millimetres (0.079\u20130.118 in) in diameter) and made with bulgur, not durum wheat. It is similarly served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth. \"Maftoul\" is an Arabic word derived from the root \"fa-ta-la,\" which means to roll or to twist, describing the hand-rolling method used to make the granules.\nIsraeli couscous, known in Hebrew as ptitim (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, p'tit\u00edm, lit. 'flakes', singular: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea, p't\u00edt, lit. 'flake'), is made up of tiny balls of toasted pasta. It was developed in Israel in the 1950s when rice was scarce due to austerity in Israel as a higher protein alternative. Despite its name in English, it is not a type of couscous (Hebrew: \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1, kus'kus, plural: \u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05e1\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, kuskus\u00edm).\nWusu-Wusu is a couscous that is prepared out of fonio in the Hausa region of Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana.\n\nSee also\nNorth African cuisine: Moroccan cuisine, Berber cuisine, Algerian cuisine, Tunisian cuisine, Libyan cuisine and Egyptian cuisine\nList of Middle Eastern dishes\nList of African

in Peru in the 1950s by Swiss immigrants to Peru.Originally its consumption was specific to high-end restaurants (during the 1950s until the 1970s), but today it is a widely available dish. The original version consisted of a chicken (cooked on a spit over charcoal and seasoned only with salt) served with large french fries and traditionally eaten with the fingers, though today additional spices are used to prepare it, and people may eat it with cutlery if they choose.  It is almost always served with creamy (mayonnaise-based) sauces, and most frequently with a salsa known as aj\u00ed.  \nIn 2013, Peruvian cuisine was listed among the top three cuisines with potential for popular menu items in the United States. Pollo a la brasa can now be found in eateries all throughout the world and is considered to be a staple item on the menu of Peruvian fusion restaurants.  It is considered a national dish of Peru; with Peruvians consuming it an average of three times per month and with rotisserie chicken restaurants accounting for 40% of the fast food industry in the country.\n\nHistory\nThe dish was developed by Roger Schuler, a Swiss resident of Chaclacayo, Lima, in 1950.  Schuler was a Swiss national who found it difficult to return to his home country during World War II, and after migrating around several locations in Chile and Peru, settled in Lima, working in hotels and restaurants.  He devised the specific method of cooking the chicken, observing his cook's technique in preparation, and gradually, along with his business partners, perfected the recipe, creating the Granja Azul restaurant in Santa Clara, district of Ate, in Lima.  After developing the initial recipe, he received a large catering order, and seeking to cook a larger volume of food in a shorter time, sought out a fellow Swiss immigrant, Franz Ulrich, a metalworker who developed a type of rotisserie oven to allow high throughput of chicken he named \"El rotombo\".  While the initial preparation only included salt as a seasoning, today preparations typically include rosemary, huacatay, black pepper, soy sauce, aj\u00ed panca, and cumin.  The Schuler family still owns the Granja Azul, and a number of other restaurants around Peru, and Ulrich continued to produce rotisserie ovens.\n\nSee also\nPeruvian cuisine\nList of chicken dishes\nList of spit-roasted foods\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Afritada", "Airline chicken", "Aj\u00ed (sauce)", "Aj\u00ed panca", "Andong jjimdak", "Arroz caldo", "Arroz con pollo", "Ate District", "Ayam bakar", "Ayam bumbu rujak", "Ayam goreng", "Ayam goreng kalasan", "Ayam kecap", "Ayam kodok", "Ayam masak merah", "Ayam pansuh", "Ayam pop", "Ayam rica-rica", "Ayam taliwang", "BK Chicken Fries", "Ballotine", "Barbecue chicken", "Barberton chicken", "Bean sprouts chicken", "Beer can chicken", "Beggar's Chicken", "Betutu", "Binakol", "Black pepper", "Bon bon chicken", "Bourbon chicken", "Bringhe", "Brown stew chicken", "Bubur ayam", "Buffalo wing", "Buldak", "Butter chicken", "Cafreal", "Caldo X\u00f3chitl", "Caldo tlalpe\u00f1o", "Cashew chicken", "Chaclacayo", "Chargha", "Chicken 65", "Chicken Chettinad", "Chicken Divan", "Chicken Fran\u00e7aise", "Chicken Kiev", "Chicken Lahori", "Chicken Marengo", "Chicken Maryland", "Chicken Picasso", "Chicken Sukka", "Chicken Vesuvio", "Chicken and duck blood soup", "Chicken and dumplings", "Chicken and mushroom pie", "Chicken and rice", "Chicken and waffles", "Chicken as food", "Chicken balls", "Chicken bog", "Chicken curry", "Chicken feet", "Chicken fingers", "Chicken inasal", "Chicken karahi", "Chicken katsu", "Chicken lollipop", "Chicken macaroni salad", "Chicken marsala", "Chicken mull", "Chicken nugget", "Chicken paprikash", "Chicken parmigiana", "Chicken riggies", "Chicken salad", "Chicken sandwich", "Chicken soup", "Chicken tabaka", "Chicken tatsuta", "Chicken tikka", "Chicken tikka masala", "Chicken \u00e0 la King", "Chikuzenni", "Chilli chicken", "Chimaek", "Chinese chicken salad", "Circassian chicken", "Claypot chicken rice", "Cock-a-leekie soup", "Coq au vin", "Cordon bleu (dish)", "Coronation chicken", "Country Captain", "Coxinha", "Crispy fried chicken", "Cumin", "C\u01a1m g\u00e0 rau th\u01a1m", "Dak-bokkeum-tang", "Dak-galbi", "Dakjuk", "Dapanji", "Dong'an chicken", "Dragon tiger phoenix", "Drunken chicken", "Engagement chicken", "Escabeche oriental", "Flying Jacob", "French fries", "Fried chicken", "Fujian red wine chicken", "Galinha \u00e0 africana", "Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa", "Galinhada", "Gallo en chicha", "General Tso's chicken", "Ginataang manok", "Gribenes", "Gulai ayam", "Hainanese chicken rice", "Hawaiian haystack", "Helzel", "Hot chicken", "Huacatay", "Huli-huli chicken", "ISBN (identifier)", "Inubaran", "Jerk (cooking)", "Jerusalem mixed grill", "Jubilee chicken", "Jujeh kabab", "KFC Original Recipe", "Kai yang", "Karaage", "Kedjenou", "King Ranch chicken", "Korean fried chicken", "Kori rotti", "Kung Pao chicken", "Kurnik (pirog)", "Kwetiau ayam", "Laziji", "Lechon manok", "Lemon chicken", "Lemon pepper wings", "Lima", "Linagpang na Manok", "List of chicken dishes", "List of cuisines", "List of fried chicken dishes", "List of spit-roasted foods", "Lontong cap go meh", "Mie ayam", "Moambe chicken", "Moo goo gai pan", "Moravian chicken pie", "Murgh musallam", "Musakhan", "Nasi liwet", "Nasi tim", "Olivier salad", "Opor ayam", "Orange chicken", "Ostropel", "Padak", "Pastilla", "Peruvian cuisine", "Philippine adobo", "Piaparan", "Piccata", "Pinchitos", "Pinikpikan", "Pininyahang manok", "Piyanggang manok", "Plecing ayam", "Pollo a la Brasa", "Pollo asado", "Poule au riz", "Poulet au fromage", "Pozharsky cutlet", "Roast chicken", "Rollatini", "Rosemary", "Rotisserie chicken", "Sajji", "Saltimbocca", "Samgye-tang", "Sanbeiji", "Satay", "Scaloppine", "Sesame chicken", "Shawarma", "Shish taouk", "Sinampalukan", "Sopas", "Sorol (food)", "Soto ayam", "Soy sauce", "Soy sauce chicken", "Spice bag", "Sweet and sour", "Swiss wing", "Switzerland", "Taiwanese fried chicken", "Talunan", "Tandoori chicken", "Tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc", "Thalassery cuisine", "Tinola", "Tongdak", "Tsukune", "Turducken", "Waterzooi", "White cut chicken", "Yakitori", "Yangnyeom chicken", "Yassa (food)", "Wikipedia:Link rot", "Template:Chicken dishes", "Template talk:Chicken dishes", "Category:Articles with dead external links from February 2024"]}, "Category:Spit cakes": {"body": "", "pages": []}, "Steaming": {"body": "Steamed foods, dishes that are typically or commonly prepared by the cooking method of steaming.", "pages": ["List of cooking techniques", "List of steamed foods", "Steaming"]}, "Category:Articles lacking in-text citations from February 2013": {"body": "B\u00e1nh t\u1ebb (literally \"rice cakes\" in Vietnamese; also called b\u00e1nh r\u0103ng b\u1eeba) is a variety of small steamed rice cake in Vietnamese cuisine.

B\u00e1nh t\u1ebb are made of rice flour, wrapped with L\u00e1 dong leaves into a long, thin cylindrical shape, and boiled thoroughly.\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb is considered one of the most typical dishes of H\u00e0 T\u00e2y Province, located near Hanoi, although it may also be found in other parts of the country. The flavors and ingredients of b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb vary from region to region.\n\nIngredients\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb are made of plain (non-glutinous) white rice (called g\u1ea1o t\u1ebb in Vietnamese), minced pork shoulder, Judas's ear fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae), onion, salt, pepper. Some variants of b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb include peanuts and chopped shiitake mushrooms.\n\nMaking\nIn order to make b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb, rice is first soaked in water until it is soft enough, then it is ground by hand with a grindstone to turn rice into a thick or watery mixture of water and rice powder. This mixture is cooked to a temperature above 50 degrees Celsius (but not to boiling) while it is stirred for 3 hours until it reaches the consistency of thick slurry.\nFor the filling, pork, onion, and shiitake mushrooms are finely minced and combined.\nTo compose the dish, a layer of rice paste is layered onto a leaf, followed by a layer of filling, and then another layer of rice paste. The final b\u00e1nh is then wrapped with the leaves tied with thread or string, forming slender cylinder. The last step involves steaming the b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb for 20 minutes until fully cooked.\n\nServing\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb are served with n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm (fish sauce) and sprinkled with black pepper. Unlike some varieties of b\u00e1nh, which are prepared only seasonally or for particular festivals, b\u00e1nh t\u1ebb are made all year round.\n\nSee also\nExternal links\n\nB\u00e1nh t\u1ebb photo", "pages": ["Auricularia auricula-judae", "Black pepper", "B\u00e1nh", "B\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng", "B\u00e1nh t\u00e9t", "Corunda", "Glutinous rice", "Ground meat", "Hallaca", "Hanoi", "H\u00e0 T\u00e2y", "Lo mai gai", "L\u00e1 dong", "N\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm", "Onion", "Pamonha", "Pasteles", "Pork", "Red River Delta", "Rice cake", "Rice flour", "Salt", "Shiitake", "Steaming", "Suman (food)", "Tamale", "Vietnam", "Vietnamese cuisine", "Vietnamese language", "Zongzi", "Wikipedia:Citing sources", "Wikipedia:External links", "Wikipedia:Further reading", "Wikipedia:When to cite", "Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check", "Help:Maintenance template removal", "Category:Articles lacking in-text citations from February 2013"]}, "Category:Bangladeshi cuisine": {"body": "Bhapa pitha is a type of rice cake mainly from the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, which includes Bangladesh, East India and Northeast India.

An example of authentic Mongolian and Buryatian cuisine, the dish is traditionally eaten at home during Tsagaan Sar, the Lunar New Year. These days it is also offered at restaurants and small cafes throughout the capital city of Ulaanbaatar.\n\nHistory and function\nBuuz is the Mongolian version of the steamed dumpling which is commonly found throughout the region. Etymologically, it reveals its origin to China, as baozi (Chinese: \u5305\u5b50; pinyin: ) is the Mandarin word for steamed dumpling. They are eaten in great quantities throughout the year but especially during the Mongolian New Year celebrations, which usually fall in February. Buuz are prepared in the weeks before and left outside to freeze; they are consumed with salads and fried bread, accompanied by suutei tsai (Mongolian tea) and vodka.\n\nIngredients and preparation\nBuuz are filled with minced lamb and mutton or beef, which is flavoured with onion and/or garlic and salted.

Eggs are beaten to a consistency similar to that used for an omelette and then steamed.

Sesame oil, soy sauce, or chicken broth may be used to add additional flavor. \nOther solid ingredients (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) may also be added to the mixture. The egg mixture is poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked.  The eggs should be steamed until just firm, so that the texture of the eggs is still smooth and silky.  A plate is usually placed on top of the bowl containing the egg mixture and left on while the egg is being steamed.  Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam.Using four eggs, the average cooking time is 10 minutes with water, 7 minutes with chicken broth. However, this is in addition to the time needed for pre-boiling water.\n\nOther cooking methods\nThis same dish can be cooked in a microwave, or in a pressure cooker. Both methods take less time, although the end product may not be of the same quality.\n\nVariations\nHomemade versions might include scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients are added to the egg mixture before steaming. It can also be enjoyed with soy sauce.

The filling (Pol Pani) is a mix of grated coconut with moong dal and jaggery syrup, which is then placed inside the rice flour noodles in the shape of a half moon, then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed before serving.\n\nSee also\nSri Lankan cuisine\nString hoppers\nPol Pani\nKozhukkatta\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Aasmi", "Aggala", "Alpal", "Aluwa", "Appam", "Apple curry", "Arrack", "Athirasa", "BT Group", "Banana pith", "Beer in Sri Lanka", "Beetroot curry", "Bibikkan", "Biryani", "Bolo fiado", "Bombai muttai", "Bread", "Breudher", "Brinjal paal curry", "Buffalo curd", "Butter cake", "Caramelise", "Cardamom", "Caryota urens", "Cashew", "Cashew curry", "Centella asiatica", "Ceylon (curry)", "Chicken curry", "Chili pepper", "Chocolate biscuit pudding", "Cinnamon", "Coconut", "Coconut milk", "Condensed milk", "Curry", "Curry tree", "Cutlet", "Cymbopogon", "Dadar gulung", "Dal", "Diyabath", "Dodol", "Dosa (food)", "Dosi (food)", "Dough", "Elumas", "Falooda", "Fish", "Fish Patties", "Gal Banis", "Gothamba roti", "Gova Kaldu", "ISBN (identifier)", "ISSN (identifier)", "Idiyappam", "Idli", "Ijzerkoekje", "Inguru dosi", "Ipomoea aquatica", "Ismoru", "Isso vade", "Jaffna lamb curry", "Jaggery", "Jam paan", "Kadala", "Kakuluwo curry", "Kalu dodol", "Kevum", "Kimbula Banis", "Kiri Dodol", "Kiri aluwa", "Kiri dosi", "Kiri hodi", "Kiribath", "Kneading", "Kokis", "Kola kanda", "Konda kevum", "Koththamalli", "Kothu roti", "Kozhukkatta", "Lamprais", "List of Sri Lankan sweets and desserts", "List of cuisines", "Love cake", "Lunumiris", "Maalu paan", "Mallung", "Malu Mirisata", "Mango curry", "Masala chai", "Medu vada", "Mie goreng", "Moju curry", "Mung bean", "Mung kevum", "Murunga curry", "Naran kevum", "Nasi goreng", "Nasi kuning", "Nian gao", "Odiyal", "Palm wine", "Pandan cake", "Pandanus amaryllifolius", "Pani Kaju", "Pani walalu", "Papadum", "Parippu vade", "Pol Pani", "Pol roti", "Pol sambol", "Polos curry", "Potato curry", "Puhul dosi", "Pumpkin curry", "Pushnambu", "Puttu", "Rasam (dish)", "Rice", "Rice and curry", "Rice flour", "Roast Paan", "Roti", "Sakkarai Muttai", "Sambal", "Satay", "Seeni sambol", "Sieve", "Sinhala language", "Sri Lanka", "Sri Lankan cuisine", "Sri Lankan omelette", "Sri Lankan tea bun", "Stir fried water spinach", "Sukiri", "Tapioca chips", "Tea", "Thakkadi", "Thala Guli", "Thala kevum", "Theti Paan", "Thuna paha", "Traditional rice of Sri Lanka", "Treacle", "Turmeric", "Undu Walalu", "Undu kevum", "University of Hawaii Press", "Upma", "Uraippu roti", "Vaalai kai sambal", "Vada (food)", "Vermicelli", "Watalappam", "Weli Thalapa", "Yugwa", "Template:Cite journal", "Template:Country data Sri Lanka", "Template:Sri Lankan cuisine", "Template talk:Sri Lankan cuisine", "Help:CS1 errors", "Category:EngvarB from September 2020", "Category:Use dmy dates from September 2020"]}, "Category:Articles with dead external links from January 2018": {"body": "Mandu (Korean: \ub9cc\ub450; Hanja: \u9945\u982d), or mandoo, are dumplings in Korean cuisine. Mandu can be steamed, boiled, pan-fried, or deep-fried. The styles also vary across regions in the Korean Peninsula. Mandu were long part of Korean royal court cuisine, but are now found in supermarkets, restaurants, and snack places such as pojangmacha and bunsikjip throughout South Korea.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name is cognate with the names of similar types of meat-filled dumplings along the Silk Road in Central Asia, such as Uyghur manta (\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627), Turkish mant\u0131, Kazakh m\u00e4nti (\u043c\u04d9\u043d\u0442\u0456), Uzbek manti, Afghan mantu and Armenian mant\u02bfi (\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0569\u056b). Chinese m\u00e1ntou (\u9992\u5934; \u9945\u982d) is also considered a cognate, which used to mean meat-filled dumplings, but now refers to steamed buns without any filling.Mandu can be divided into gyoja (\uad50\uc790; \u9903\u5b50) type and poja (\ud3ec\uc790; \u5305\u5b50) type. In Chinese, the categories of dumplings are called ji\u01ceozi (\u997a\u5b50; \u9903\u5b50) and b\u0101ozi (\u5305\u5b50) respectively, which are cognates with the Korean words. In Japanese, the former-type dumplings are called gy\u014dza (\u9903\u5b50), which is also a cognate. In Mongolian, the latter-type dumplings are called buuz (\u0431\u0443\u0443\u0437) and in Nepalese and Tibetan, they are called momo (\u092e\u092e, \u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42)  all of which is also cognates with the former.\n\nHistory\nMandu are believed to have been first brought to Korea by Yuan Mongolians in the 14th century during the reign of the Goryeo dynasty. The state religion of Goryeo was Buddhism, which discouraged consumption of meat. The Mongolian incursion into Goryeo relaxed the religious prohibition against consuming meat, and mandu was among the newly imported dishes that included meat.\nAnother possibility is mandu came to Korea at a much earlier period from the Middle East through the Silk Road. Historians point out many cuisines based on wheat, such as dumplings and noodles which originated from Mesopotamia and gradually spread from there. It also spread east along the Silk Road, leaving many versions of mandu throughout Central and East Asia.A Goryeo-era folk song, \"Ssanghwajeom\", tells a story of a mandu shop (ssanghwa meaning 'dumplings', and jeom meaning 'shop') run by a foreigner, probably of Central Asian origin.\n\nVarieties\nIf the dumplings are grilled or pan-fried, they are called gun-mandu (\uad70\ub9cc\ub450); when steamed, jjin-mandu (\ucc10\ub9cc\ub450); and when boiled, mul-mandu (\ubb3c\ub9cc\ub450). In North Korea, mandu styles vary in different regions of the country. In particular, Pulmuone is releasing cheese dumplings, sweet seed dumplings with sugar and spicy dumplings.\nMul-mandu (\ubb3c\ub9cc\ub450) means \"boiled mandu\".\nGun-mandu (\uad70\ub9cc\ub450) is pan-fried mandu. It is derived from guun-mandu \uad6c\uc6b4\ub9cc\ub450=>\uad70\ub9cc\ub450 to mean \"panned\" dumplings.'.\nJjin-mandu (\ucc10\ub9cc\ub450) is steamed, either in a traditional bamboo steamer or modern versions.\nGullin-mandu (\uad74\ub9b0\ub9cc\ub450), also called gulmandu, is a variety of mandu in a ball shape without a covering. It is mainly eaten in summer.\nWang mandu (\uc655\ub9cc\ub450) is a bun stuffed with pork and vegetables, similar to the Chinese baozi.\nPyeonsu (\ud3b8\uc218), mandu stuffed with vegetables in a rectangular shape. It is mainly eaten in summer and a local specialty of Kaesong, North Korea.\nEo-mandu (\uc5b4\ub9cc\ub450), mandu wrapped with sliced fish fillet. It was originally eaten in Korean royal court and yangban (noble class) families.\nSaengchi-mandu (\uc0dd\uce58\ub9cc\ub450), mandu stuffed with pheasant meat, beef, and tofu, that was eaten in Korean royal court and in the Seoul area during winter.\nSeongnyu-mandu (\uc11d\ub958\ub9cc\ub450), literally \"pomegranate dumpling\" because of the shape.\nSo-mandu (\uc18c\ub9cc\ub450), mandu stuffed with only vegetables, which were originally eaten in Buddhist temples.\nGyuasang (\uaddc\uc544\uc0c1), mandu stuffed with shredded cucumber and minced beef in the shape of a sea cucumber. It is mainly eaten in the summer.\nKimchi-mandu (\uae40\uce58\ub9cc\ub450), mandu with stuffing which contains kimchi. The addition of kimchi gives it a spicier taste compared to other mandu.\nNapjak-mandu (\ub0a9\uc791\ub9cc\ub450), a Daegu specialty. As the name suggests (napjak in Korean means 'flat'), the mandu is not as plump as the other types. A small amount of chopped glass noodles and chopped vegetables go inside the mandu. The mandu is then boiled once and pan-fried once, finished off with a dipping sauce made with soy sauce and red pepper powder, and garnished on top with vegetables.\n\nDishes made with mandu\nManduguk is a variety of Korean soup (guk) made with mandu in beef broth. In the Korean royal court, the dish was called byeongsi (\u9920\u5319) while in the Eumsik dimibang, a 17th-century cookbook, it was called \"seokryutang\" (\uc11d\ub958\ud0d5).\n\nSimilar food\nIn Korean cuisine, mandu generally denotes a type of filled dumpling similar to the Mongolian buuz, a Tibetan-Nepalese momo and Turkic mant\u0131, and some variations are similar to the Chinese jiaozi and the Japanese gyoza.\nThey are similar to pelmeni and pierogi in some Slavic cultures.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2003 South Korean film Oldboy, the protagonist Oh Dae-Su is fed a steady diet of fried mandu, the food that he detests the most, while he is imprisoned. After he is released, he visits various restaurants serving the dish to get clues and determine where he was held captive.\nWonder Girls member Ahn Sohee is often referred to as Mandu due to her cheeks resembling the shape of mandu.\nIn the 2020 DreamWorks animated series Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, Kipo finds a mutated pig and names it Mandu because it resembles the dumpling.\n\nSee

Although the term is a counterpart of jjim \u2014 a category of dishes that are made by steaming meat or seafood \u2014 the concept is not clearly settled.Other dishes similar to seon include gajiseon (\uac00\uc9c0\uc120, steamed eggplant), gochuseon (\uace0\ucd94\uc120, steamed chili pepper), donggwaseon (\ub3d9\uacfc\uc120, steamed winter melon), museon (\ubb34\uc120, steamed radish), baechuseon (steamed Napa cabbage) and dubuseon (steamed tofu).\n\nPreparation\nTo make a hobakseon (\ud638\ubc15\uc120) or oiseon (\uc624\uc774\uc120), a cucumber (or zucchini) is cut into pieces about 4 to 5 cm. in length and then quartered. The pieces are lightly salted and then slightly squeezed to drain water from them. Beef or chicken, along with onion, is chopped and mixed with seasonings to make the stuffing. Then, prepared pieces of the cucumber are stuffed with the meat and placed in a pot. After that, pour the vegetable broth on the ingredients until they are partially covered with liquid. Soaked and stuffed cucumber boiled or steamed with the sauce for about 5-10 minutes. The dish is served with slices of seogi (\uc11d\uc774, Umbilicaria esculenta), chili threads and egg garnish place on top of the cucumber, similarly to gomyeong (\uace0\uba85, garnishes).\n\nIn historical cookbooks\nAccording to Eumsik dimibang, a Korean cookbook written during mid-Joseon Dynasty, the historical recipe of the donggwaseon (\ub3d9\uacfc\uc120, a variety of seon made with dongga (winter melon)) is very different from today's version. \nThick slices of winter melon are lightly parboiled in the water and put into a bowl with the boiled mixture of ganjang, water and oil. In a new bowl boiled ganjang is mixed with minced ginger and then, poured over the vegetables. Donggwaseon is served with vinegar which is spread over the dish.In Siui jeonseo, a cookbook written in the late 19th century, a recipe of hobakseon (\ud638\ubc15\uc120, a zucchini seon) is similar to the modern one. A zucchini is hollowed out, filled with various condiments and then steamed. A sauce made with vinegar, ganjang and honey is poured over the ready dish. The dish is served with sliced chili pepper, seogi (\uc11d\uc774 Umbilicaria esculenta) and jidan (fried eggs) that are placed on the zucchini and sprinkled with pine nuts.However, the term did not reach its modern meaning until the late 1930s.  Cookbooks that were written before that time use the term very differently.

The Siru is also used during shamanic rituals and is even offered on the tables for daegamsin (\ub300\uac10\uc2e0, state official God). The Siru is not an everyday utensil but is one for preparing and serving the sacrificial dishes during rituals, which also means that siru-tteok is not a casual dish for every day enjoyment.\nThe making of siru-tteok is said to be the oldest form of tteok (\ub5a1).Tteok (\ub5a1), or steamed rice cake, which is made by steaming powdered rice, then pounding or rolling the dough, itself dates back to 57 B.C.E, along with the siru. The Siru-tteok dish is a layered cake of the glutinous rice that is filled often filled with beans and/or red beans (pat, \ud325), and the most seen and basic sacrifice offered in rituals for household gods. This cake is generally used for bad fortune prevention rituals (aengmagi) to bring wealth, luck and health into the households. The red beans/ fillings is believed to chase away bad spirits, and the other type of siru-tteok cake is the Baekseolgi, which is pure white, and is offered to the higher gods, including Cheonsin (\ucc9c\uc2e0, Celestial God), Sansin (\uc0b0\uc2e0, Mountain God) and Yongsin (\uc6a9\uc2e0, Dragon God), reflecting the folk belief that the latter two are considered to be as high up and divine as Cheonsin(\ucc9c\uc2e0).\n\nPreparation\nSirutteok is made by soaking rice or glutinous rice in water and then grinding it. Thus prepared, the rice flour is put in a siru and steamed. According to steaming method, sirutteok is subdivided into two groups: seolgitteok (\uc124\uae30\ub5a1) and kyeotteok (\ucf1c\ub5a1). Seolgitteok---also called muritteok (\ubb34\ub9ac\ub5a1)---is regarded as the most basic form of sirutteok and is made only with rice. \"Kyeotteok\" consists of multiple layers of azuki bean or other bean powder and a rice-glutinous rice mixture.\n\nIngredients\nThe main ingredients for \"sirutteok\" are rice (\uba65\uc300 mepssal in Korean) or glutinous rice (\ucc39\uc300 chapssal), which sometimes are mixed. Other grains and beans (such as azuki bean, mung bean and sesame, wheat flour or starch) can also be mixed with the rice. Various fruits and nuts are used as subsidiary ingredients, such as persimmon, peach or apricot, chestnut, walnut, and pine nut. In addition, vegetables or herbs can be used to flavor the tteok. Danggwi leaves (\ub2f9\uadc0\uc78e; Ostericum grosseserratum), seogi mushroom (manna lichen),  radish, artemisia, pepper, and Korean wine for example, whereas honey and sugar are used as sweeteners.\n\nVarieties\nBaekseolgi (\ubc31\uc124\uae30) - a variety of siru tteok. It literally means white snow tteok which is made of white rice.\nKongtteok (\ucf69\ub5a1) - tteok made with various kinds of beans\nJeungpyeon (\uc99d\ud3b8) - tteok made with makgeolli (unfiltered rice wine)\nMujigae tteok (\ubb34\uc9c0\uac1c\ub5a1) [1] - literally \"rainbow tteok\"; this variety of tteok has colorful stripes. The tteok is used especially for janchi (\uc794\uce58), Korean banquet, party, or feast like dol (celebrating a baby's first birthday), Hwangap (celebrating 60 years old people's birthday), or gyeonhon janchi (wedding party)\nHobak-tteok\n\nSee also\nSongpyeon\nKorean cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["Apricot", "Artemisia (genus)", "Azuki bean", "Black pepper", "Calorie", "Chestnut", "Empas", "EncyKorea", "Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture", "Food energy", "Fruit", "Glutinous rice", "Hangul", "Hanja", "Hobak-tteok", "Hwangap", "Korea", "Korean cuisine", "Korean language", "Korean radish", "Korean wine", "Lichen", "List of steamed foods", "Makgeolli", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Mung bean", "National Folk Museum of Korea", "Peach", "Persimmon", "Pine nut", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Rice", "Rice cake", "Sesame", "Songpyeon", "Starch", "Steaming", "Sweetener", "Tteok", "Umbilicaria esculenta", "Walnut", "Wheat flour"]}, "Template talk:English cuisine": {"body": "A suet pudding is a boiled, steamed or baked pudding made with wheat flour and suet (raw, hard fat of beef or mutton found around the kidneys), often with breadcrumb, dried fruits such as raisins, other preserved fruits, and spices. The British term pudding usually refers to a dessert or sweet course, but suet puddings may be savoury. \nMany variations are strongly associated with British cuisine. Recipes vary greatly and can be desserts or savoury courses. They are typically boiled or steamed, though some baked variations and recipes adapted for microwave ovens exist. Modern recipes may substitute butter or vegetable shortening for the eponymous suet.\nExamples include spotted dick, Christmas pudding, treacle pudding, clootie dumpling, jam roly-poly and many others. Savoury versions include rabbit, chicken, game and steak and kidney pudding.\nThe Sussex pond pudding and the Paignton pudding are local variations of suet puddings.\n\nHistory\nThe suet pudding dates back to at least the start of the 18th century. Mary Kettilby's 1714 A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery gives a recipe for \"An excellent Plumb-Pudding\", which calls for \"one pound of Suet, shred very small and sifted\" along with raisins, flour, sugar, eggs, and a little salt; these were to be boiled for \"four hours at least\".Christmas pudding developed from a meat dish. The ancestor of the suet pudding was pottage, a meat and vegetable stew originating in Roman times. This was prepared in a large cauldron, the ingredients being slow cooked, with dried fruits, sugar and spices added. In the 15th century, plum pottage was a mixture of meat, vegetables and fruit served at the beginning of a meal.The name suet pudding refers to the fat mixed with the flour; it is the fat from around the kidneys of mammals. Pudding is a British term often used for steamed dishes, both sweet and savoury, but also for Yorkshire Pudding (a batter dish) and Bread and Butter Pudding (a custard dessert).\n\nAdvantages\nSuet has a melting point of between 45 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F and 122 \u00b0F). Butter, by comparison, melts between 32 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F to 95 \u00b0F). As a result, suet fat is less likely to melt into the flour when making the pastry. When the pudding is cooked, the suet melts after the pastry has had a chance to set, leaving behind holes. This structure allows the pastry to better stand up to wet fillings and gives a lighter, fluffier texture.\n\nCultural references\nIn George Orwell's 1947 essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys,\" recounting the miseries of his preparatory school education, St Cyprian's School saves money by serving distasteful unsweetened suet pudding as a first course  to \"break the boys' appetites.\"In his 1941 essay \"England Your England\" he has a more benign view of it:\n\nIn left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings.\n\nSee also\nEnglish cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\n\n== References ==", "pages": ["A Book of Mediterranean Food", "A Collection of Above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery", "A History of English Food", "A New System of Domestic Cookery", "Antony Worrall Thompson", "Apple pie", "Bacon", "Bakewell tart", "Banbury cake", "Battalia pie", "Battenberg cake", "Beef Wellington", "Black pudding", "Bread and Butter Pudding", "Bread and butter pudding", "Bubble and squeak", "Carrot cake", "Cauliflower cheese", "Charles Elm\u00e9 Francatelli", "Cheesecake", "Chicken tikka masala", "Christmas pudding", "Chutney", "Clarissa Dickson Wright", "Clootie dumpling", "Cobbler (food)", "Constance Spry", "Cook's Info", "Coronation chicken", "Coronation quiche", "Crumble", "Cumberland rum nicky", "Currant bun", "Curry in the United Kingdom", "Custard", "Delia Smith", "Devilled kidneys", "Dorothy Hartley", "Eccles cake", "Elinor Fettiplace", "Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book", "Eliza Acton", "Eliza Smith", "Elizabeth David", "Elizabeth Raffald", "English cuisine", "Eton mess", "Eve's pudding", "Faggot (food)", "Fanny Cradock", "Fergus Henderson", "Fish and chips", "Florence Petty", "Food in England", "Fruit fool", "Full breakfast", "Game pie", "Gary Rhodes", "George Orwell", "Gervase Markham", "Gingerbread", "Gordon Ramsay", "HP Sauce", "Hannah Glasse", "Hannah Woolley", "Heston Blumenthal", "Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall", "ISBN (identifier)", "Ice cream cone", "Isabella Beeton", "Jam Roly-Poly", "Jam roly-poly", "Jamie Oliver", "Jane Grigson", "Jellied eels", "John Nott (cook)", "Jugging", "Keith Floyd", "Kenelm Digby", "Ketchup", "Kidney", "Kipper", "Knickerbocker glory", "Lancashire hotpot", "Lardy cake", "Le Gavroche", "List of English cheeses", "List of English dishes", "List of savoury puddings", "List of steamed foods", "List of sweet puddings", "Madeira cake", "Marco Pierre White", "Marguerite Patten", "Maria Rundell", "Marmalade", "Martha Bradley", "Mary Berry", "Mary Eales", "Mary Kettilby", "Medieval cuisine", "Melting point", "Merriam-Webster", "Michel Roux Jr.", "Mince pie", "Modern Cookery for Private Families", "Mortis (food)", "Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management", "Mrs Mary Eales's Receipts", "Nigel Slater", "Nigella Lawson", "Paignton", "Pancake", "Parkin (cake)", "Pasty", "Pease pudding", "Piccalilli", "Pie", "Platinum Pudding", "Ploughman's lunch", "Pork pie", "Pottage", "Potted shrimps", "Pudding", "Queen of Puddings", "Rachel Khoo", "Raisin", "Rationing in the United Kingdom", "Richard Pynson", "Rick Stein", "River Cottage", "Roast beef", "Robert May (cook)", "Romano-British culture", "Salad cream", "Sandwich", "Sausage", "Sausage roll", "Savoury (small dish)", "Scone", "Scouse (food)", "Shepherd's pie", "Sponge cake", "Spotted dick", "St Cyprian's School", "Steak and kidney pudding", "Steaming", "Sticky toffee pudding", "Suet", "Summer pudding", "Sussex pond pudding", "Sweet and sour", "Syllabub", "Tea", "TheGuardian.com", "The Accomplisht Cook", "The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy", "The Boke of Cokery", "The Closet of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie Kt.

Common ingredients include ham, sausage, Spam, baked beans, kimchi, instant noodles, gochujang and American cheese. The dish is now a popular anju (accompaniment to alcoholic drinks) and a comfort food cooked in a large pot for multiple people. It also goes by the English names army stew, army base stew, and spicy sausage stew.\nAround the time of the dish's invention, South Korea was among the poorest countries in the world, with many of its citizens relying on international aid for survival. The dish has its origins in a predecessor often called kkulkuri-juk (\uafc0\uafc0\uc774\uc8fd; lit. piggy porridge), that was created around the time of the Korean War, using food waste from or goods illegally smuggled off of United States Forces Korea bases. A prominent ingredient of the dish, Spam, was only made legally available for sale in 1987, around the time that South Korea democratized.\nAlthough the dish came from conditions of poverty, it has remained consistently popular, even during and after South Korea's rapid economic growth. Its low cost, flexibility, and simplicity have been praised. In South Korea, there are many restaurants that specialize in budae-jjigae. Gyeonggi Province's city of Uijeongbu, which claims to have first made the dish, has a \"Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae Street\" with a high concentration of specialty restaurants. Chains like Nolboo have operated over a thousand locations in the country.\nBudae-jjigae is often seen as symbolic of modern Korean history and even of American imperialism. Some older Koreans who lived through the Korean War avoid the dish, as they see it as a reminder of a painful past. Younger Koreans reportedly simply enjoy it, while acknowledging its complicated history.\n\nName\nThe word budae (\ubd80\ub300) refers to military camps. The suffix -jjigae (\ucc0c\uac1c) refers to a type of stew that has a thicker consistency than guk (soup) and has more ingredients.Its name is sometimes translated as \"army base stew\", \"army stew\", \"spicy sausage stew\", or \"sausage stew\".\n\nDescription\nBudae-jjigae is made with a wide variety of ingredients. The soup base can be plain water, although most prefer to make it with a fish, meat, or bone-based broth such as sagol-yuksu (\uc0ac\uace8\uc721\uc218; lit. sagol broth). Common ingredients include ham, sausage, lunch meats (e.g. Spam), baked beans, kimchi (fermented vegetables), instant ramen noodles, spicy flavoring packs that come with the ramen, cellophane noodles, gochujang (pepper paste), Vienna sausages, bacon, tofu, pork, ground beef, mandu (dumplings), macaroni, tteok (rice cakes), American cheese, mozzarella, minari (water celery), scallions, chili peppers, garlic, corn, zucchini, mushrooms, and other in-season vegetables. Spam or similar lunch meats are often described as a central part of the dish.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish is based on a stock or soup base, which can be either vegan or made with animal products. Seasoning paste is also used, and usually contains gochujang and other flavorants such as soy sauce and sugar. Chopped ingredients and noodles are then added to the stock, with variability on if the noodles are added before or after the liquid comes to a boil.The dish is often enjoyed communally, with multiple people sharing a pot. In restaurants, the dish comes with a set of base ingredients; more can be added for additional charge. The low cost of the ingredients, flexibility of the recipe, and ease of preparation have been praised.\n\nVariants\nIngredients for the dish are sold and exported from South Korea to other countries in kits. Various restaurants create their own versions of the dish with unorthodox ingredients. For example, it was reported in 2022 that a restaurant in Apgujeong used tomato soup as a base. Another restaurant in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province that was opened in 1973 has a budae-gogi (\"military base meat\") stir-fry that has been described as \"budae-jjigae without soup\".A variant of the dish is named after a U.S. President. A form of budae-jjigae developed in Yongsan-gu, Seoul is called Johnson-tang (\uc874\uc2a8\ud0d5; Jonseuntang; lit. Johnson soup), after Lyndon B. Johnson, who is said to have enjoyed the dish during his 1966 visit to South Korea. The restaurant Johnson ate the dish at, Bada Sikdang (\ubc14\ub2e4\uc2dd\ub2f9), still serves Johnson-tang as its signature dish. In Johnson-tang, kimchi is replaced with plain napa cabbage leaves, and ramen noodles are not added. Cheese is included by default, rather than being a requested addition (as is the case in some restaurants). In addition, while many budae-jjigae restaurants cook the dish at the table, Johnson-tang is served already cooked.There are Uijeongbu and Songtan styles of the dish. The Uijeongbu style uses barley-based gochujang, and has been described as having a thicker and spicier broth. The Songtan style prominently features napa cabbage.Some opt to exclude or substitute some of its salty, preserved, or perceived low-quality ingredients. Vegan varieties of the dish exist.\n\nHistory\nBackground\nThe 20th century was turbulent for the Korean peninsula. In 1945, Korea was liberated from its status as a colony of the Empire of Japan. Koreans had been exploited; for example, from 1939 to 1945, around 700,000\u2013800,000 Koreans were moved to Japan to work in slavery-like conditions. The situation was made worse due to the collapse of the economy that had been run by imperial Japan, and the subsequent division of Korea between the Soviet Civil Administration in the North and the United States Army Military Government in the South. The difficulties did not stop, and only worsened; around 10% of the population died during the Korean War, which greatly disrupted the economy and society. By the end of the war, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Around that time, many Koreans depended on international aid for survival.Many foreign products were not legally available to South Koreans, and some were made artificially expensive due to tariffs even until 1987. During a crackdown on black market trading under the Park Chung Hee administration, smuggling food like Spam was a crime punishable by death. To circumvent this, goods were smuggled off bases, notably by Korean prostitutes working there, who were widely socially stigmatized. Canned goods were particularly prized for their long shelf life and taste. Black markets called \"Yankee markets\" (\uc591\ud0a4\uc2dc\uc7a5; Yangki-sijang) formed that specialized in the trade of these goods. Some of these markets still exist today, including one in Incheon, although they are now regular markets.\n\nKkulkkuri-juk\nA predecessor to the dish is often called kkulkkuri-juk (\uafc0\uafc0\uc774\uc8fd; lit. piggy porridge), although it may have additionally gone by \"UN Stew\" (as in \"United Nations\"; \uc720\uc5d4\ud0d5; \uc720\uc5d4\u6e6f; yuen-tang). Its ingredients and method of cooking were more inconsistent than its successor's. One variant of the dish is attested to in the Pusan Perimeter. It was made with butter, canned pineapples, cabbages, onions, American cheese, and the occasional piece of meat (these rare pieces of scrap meat were often described as \ubd80\ub300\uace0\uae30; budae-gogi; lit. military base meat). The Busan variant of the dish also led to the development of dwaeji gukbap, a pork-based rice dish.The dish used American sausages, which tend to be greasier and saltier than Korean ones. Modern budae-jjigae is instead made with milder ingredients, and seasoning is added to the soup. It also lacked instant ramen, as ramen had not yet reached Korea by then. Coincidentally, Jeon Jung-yun (\uc804\uc911\uc724) cited the poor quality of kkulkkuri-juk as an inspiration for why he created the first domestic instant ramen brand Samyang Ramen. Jeon alleges he deliberately set ramen's price as low as possible, in order to make it accessible to people who would otherwise eat kkulkkuri-juk.Jeon felt that way because a number of people have recalled that, while the dish was highly sought after and enjoyed when consumed, its actual quality was poor in hindsight, especially because it was sometimes made with food scraps picked out of garbage from the military bases.One significant and common issue was the presence of inedible objects. The ends of cigarettes, toothpicks, and tissues could be found in the mix. In 2010, Lee Si-yeon recalled an incident from his boyhood, when he worked at Camp Henry:\nOne day, I mustered up the courage to speak to the military chaplain. He was a major called \"Ap\" (\uc555). In simple English, I asked if they could not throw away food scraps, as Koreans were picking them out of the garbage... He said \"Let me see this for myself\". [I feared that he would ban Koreans from taking out the food scraps]... He followed me to the market, where he bought a bowl of kkulkkuri-juk and took a bite. Major Ap's eyes welled up with tears. He ate the whole bowl in silence. The next day, [he told me that he had sent] a notice to all U.S. military bases that read \"Koreans are eating food scraps from the bases, so be cautious to not let foreign substances enter them.\"\nDespite the low quality of the dish, many Koreans still could not afford it. According to Jeon, a bowl cost around 5 won in 1963 (equivalent to \u20a9245 in 2017). The dish persisted until the mid-1960s, when the economic situation somewhat improved.\n\nDevelopment of budae-jjigae\nSince its development, budae-jjigae has remained consistently popular in South Korea. However, it's not known with certainty where the dish first arose; a number of restaurants and cities claim to be the origin. It even possibly arose independently in multiple places due to shared circumstances across South Korea.According to sociolinguist Yang Minho, the dish was first made in the northern part of South Korea and later propagated south, following the early trajectory of the Korean War. Possible places of origin include the regions of Uijeongbu, Pyeongtaek, Munsan, and Dongducheon.One person who claimed to be the original inventor was Heo Gi-Suk (\ud5c8\uae30\uc219), a North Korean defector. Heo worked at a fishcake stand in Uijeongbu, and occasionally encountered people who asked her to cook meats they had acquired from the nearby military base. She began by simply stirfrying the meats, but eventually turned the dish into a stew containing kimchi, lard, and wild sesame oil. Heo eventually opened a restaurant in 1960 called Odeng Sikdang (\uc624\ub385\uc2dd\ub2f9; lit. Fishcake Restaurant), which nominally served fishcakes, but was popular for serving budae-jjigae. This drew the ire of the customs office, which confiscated her ingredients and charged her fines on a number of occasions. The restaurant reportedly had long lines as of 2013, despite multiple competitors close by. Heo died in 2014, but the restaurant was still open as of June 2020.An article in the Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture claims that the dish was popular among factory workers in the 1960s and 1970s. However, according to one writer for the JoongAng Ilbo in 2016, the dish was not common in restaurants in the late 1960s. Another writer that published an article for the Cultural Heritage Administration in 2018 claimed that the dish did not reach national popularity until the 1970s.In 1963, instant ramen entered the South Korean market, and eventually made its way into budae-jjigae. Over time, anchovy broth (flavored with gochujang and kimchi) began to be used as the base of the soup, a practice that has since persisted in some variations of budae-jjigae.\n\nRecent history\nAfter the June Democratic Struggle of 1987, South Korea finally democratized after decades of dictatorships. In addition, by then the economy was significantly improved in the wake of the South Korean economic miracle. Spam was legalized in that year, after a Korean company purchased the rights to make it locally. According to an article by Hahna Yoon in the BBC, it is around this time that the dish's status changed from survival food to comfort food. That same year, Nolboo (\ub180\ubd80), a restaurant franchise specializing in the dish, opened. As of June 2020, it operated around 1,000 locations across the country.\n\nSpread\nThe dish now has some international popularity. In a 2015 episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Bourdain described the dish to journalist Anderson Cooper as \"a classic example of necessity being the mother of deliciousness\". Bourdain later featured the dish in his 2016 book Appetites: A Cookbook:\n\nIt's the ultimate dorm food. Just looking at the ingredients might make it sound like a horror, but it very quickly comes together and becomes delicious. It captures the essence of great cooking over the last few centuries: improvisational, born of war and hardship, nostalgic, sentimental, and transformative.\nAccording to a 2016 survey conducted by the Korea Tourism Organization of 200,000 Chinese tourists to South Korea, budae-jjigae was most often ranked as their favorite dish that they ate in the country. In 2019, the Michelin Guide included the dish on a list of \"Must-Eat Dishes in South Korea\".A number of restaurants in the United States have served the dish. This includes the Portland, Oregon restaurant Han Oak, and the New York City restaurant Danji. The dish is served in some restaurants in Beijing, China and Tokyo, Japan.\n\nCultural legacy\nDespite its widespread consumption, the dish has a somewhat mixed legacy. Some have noted that it evokes memories of a painful period in Korean history. In 2020, C\u0103t\u0103lina Stanciu wrote that \"[t]he transformation of the Korean people's trauma story is embodied through the bowl of budaejjigae\". Some older Koreans call the dish \"garbage stew\" and avoid it, mostly because of its history and also because of its unhealthy ingredients. In 2014, anthropologist Grace M. Cho wrote of the dish:\n\nI listened to the oral histories of Korean War survivors living in the United States, who spoke about the days during and after the war when they sought food outside U.S. Army bases. They recalled waiting in long lines outside the mess halls to buy bags of \"leftovers\", though some of them referred to the bags plainly as \"garbage\". They\u2019d say things like, \"Americans have the best food and throw it away, and then Koreans buy that garbage,\" their voices filled with humiliation, resentment, and gratitude all at once.Some note that the dish evokes images of American imperialism, particularly related to controversies surrounding U.S. military bases in South Korea. Some Korean Americans, particularly those who were adopted after the Korean War or are mixed-race children of war brides, have noted parallels between the dish's mix of cultures and their own. The inclusion of Spam is a point of contention, as the food has been described as \"the furthest thing from refined\" and made the subject of jokes in popular culture. This contrasts with the perception of the food in South Korea during the 1990s, where it was seen as somewhat of a luxury. Some of these emotions have been explored through art. A 2005 multimedium art piece entitled BooDaeChiGae displayed a video inside of a C-ration can. The video showed the dish being made, while the audio was of a Korean War survivor talking about living off garbage from military bases.These mixed emotions have led to some attempts to rename the dish. The city of Uijeongbu, which is north of Seoul and has many army bases, is known for its budae-jjigae. Since 1998, it has had a street with numerous budae-jjigae restaurants. In 1999, the local government attempted to change the name of the dish to Uijeongbu-jjigae (\"Uijeongbu Stew\"), and the street accordingly. The new name failed to gain traction, and the name of the street was eventually changed back.The dish has been used as a neutral or positive metaphor for cosmopolitanism. In a 2020 book, researcher of Korean cinema Christina Klein used the term \"budae-jjigae cinema\" to describe South Korean films after the Korean War. She compared the invention of the dish to how filmmakers picked and chose various ideas \"without asking within profoundly unequal relations of power, and [incorporated] that material into new cultural production\". Jeong Dong-hyeon, writing for The Chosun Ilbo, likened the food to the music group BTS, which borrows elements of Western culture but is widely accepted as Korean. In 2017, the mayor of Uijeongbu used the dish as a metaphor for U.S.\u2013South Korea ties. Western interest in the dish has been examined. Nicolyn Woodcock criticized Bourdain's portrayal of the dish, pointing to how Bourdain called the dish a \"gift of the G.I.\", how he allegedly played into perceptions of Asian exoticism, and how he did not explore the social connotations surrounding it.Whether budae-jjigae can be considered Korean cuisine (\ud55c\uc2dd; hansik) has been called into question. According to one 2022 survey, Korean adults tend to view the food as Korean but less so than dishes like kimchi-jjigae. The chef Park Chan-il contended that Korean cuisine had previously accepted new adaptations, and that what mattered was the enjoyment of the dish. She pointed out that kimchi, which Koreans consider quintessentially Korean, only became spicy after the Portuguese brought peppers to Asia in the 16th century.Others embrace the identity of the dish, while acknowledging its past. Some see it as a hallmark of South Korea's success via its globalization. In 2020, Chef Hooni Kim, whose restaurant served the dish and was the first Korean restaurant to obtain a Michelin star, observed that younger Koreans tend to have more positive reactions to the dish. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t think Korea\u2019s younger generation considers the country having been poor as something to be ashamed of. Budae-jjigae is an honest portrayal of where our country was and how far our country has come.\n\nSee also\nPagpag: a dish born from poverty in the Philippines\nMulligan stew: an American poverty dish\nHan (cultural): Korean expression of sorrow related to the events of the 20th century\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nREFUGEES \u2013 footage of refugees living in difficult conditions during the Korean War\n(\ud604\ucda9\uc77c \ud2b9\uc9d1) \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc758\ubc25\uc0c1 - \uac00\uc7a5\uc2ac\ud508 \ud55c\ub07c, \uc804\uc7c1\uacfc\ubc25\uc0c1 | 20130606 KBS\ubc29\uc1a1 on YouTube \u2013 a 2013 Korean-language documentary covering wartime food in South Korea.

The chafing dish could be used at table or provided with a cover for keeping food warm on a buffet. Double dishes that provide a protective water jacket are known as bains-marie and help keep delicate foods, such as fish, warm while preventing overcooking.\n\nHistory\nThe Roman politician and writer Cicero described a \"kind of saucepan of Corinthian brass\", writing \"This simple and ingenious vessel possesses a double bottom, the upper one holds the light delicacies . . . and the fire is lit underneath\".Fragments of ceramic chafing dishes are common in the archaeology of medieval city sites, such as York, England. Chafing dishes in the form of charcoal-burning braziers are familiar in 17th-century American inventories almost from the start. Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne, Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois (Paris, 1652) mentions the use of a r\u00e9chaut in a recipe for champignons \u00e0 l'olivier. In describing the Velazquez genre painting (illustration), sometimes art historians not handy in the kitchen describe her as frying eggs in her earthenware dish. In 1520, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s reported to Charles V the manner in which Montezuma was served meals in Tenochtitlan:\n\nHe was served in the following manner: Every day as soon as it was light, six hundred nobles and men of rank were in attendance at the palace, who either sat, or walked about the halls and galleries, and passed their time in conversation, but without entering the apartment where his person was. The servants and attendants of these nobles remained in the court-yards, of which there were two or three of great extent, and in the adjoining street, which was also very spacious. They all remained in attendance from morning until night; and when his meals were served, the nobles were likewise served with equal profusion, and their servants and secretaries also had their allowance. Daily his larder and wine-cellar were open to all who wished to eat or drink. The meals were served by three or four hundred youths, who brought on an infinite variety of dishes; indeed, whenever he dined or supped, the table was loaded with every kind of flesh, fish, fruits, and vegetables that the country produced. As the climate is cold, they put a chafing-dish with live coals under every plate and dish, to keep them warm...\nIn England silver braziers without handles, upon which a dish would be set, are mentioned in the reign of Queen Anne; wooden balls kept the heat of the charcoal in the pierced container from being transferred to the table surface. Dish-crosses and the chafing dish with a handle were introductions of the reign of George II. In the American colonies, \"One chafing dish\" was inventoried among the silver at Abraham de Peyster's death in New York, 1728, though only two colonial New York examples are known to survive.In a light form and heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish could also be  used for cooking various dainty dishes at table\u2014of fish, cream, eggs or cheese\u2014for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when \"chafing-dish suppers\" became fashionable, even in households where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmer's Chafing Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898.\n\nModern uses\nHosts dazzled their guests not just with their sparkling new equipment, but with their flamb\u00e9ing and their cr\u00eapes Suzette. Betty Crocker hailed the chafing dish... as providing dinners that were \"exotic, sophisticated, and intimate.\"\nModern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles. Standard uses of a chafing-dish in restaurants are finishing the sauces of dishes such as pressed duck and fettuccine Alfredo or in presenting flamb\u00e9 dishes such as cr\u00eapes Suzette and Steak Diane. In homes, it can be used to prepare and present dishes at table which must be kept hot, notably  Welsh rarebit and cheese fondue. The home version sometimes includes a cover.\nHome and restaurant chafing dishes have gone in and out of fashion, notably in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s.In institutional and catering use, chafing dishes often consist of large, covered rectangular pans, sometimes disposable, held in a rack or frame over water heated by an alcohol burner as a kind of steam table for keeping food warm at a buffet. They are not used for cooking or reheating food.\n\nSee also\nChafing fuel\nList of cooking vessels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBraziers and chafing dishes", "pages": ["Abraham de Peyster", "Alcohol burner", "Anne, Queen of Great Britain", "Bain-marie", "Brazier", "Buffet", "Chafing fuel", "Charcoal", "Charles I of Spain", "Cheese fondue", "Cicero", "Cr\u00eapes Suzette", "Diego Vel\u00e1zquez", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition", "Fannie Farmer", "Fettuccine Alfredo", "Flamb\u00e9", "Food warmer", "Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne", "Genre", "George II of Great Britain", "Gorham Manufacturing Company", "Gueridon service", "Hernan Cort\u00e9s", "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s", "Hugh Chisholm", "ISBN (identifier)", "John Coney (silversmith)", "List of cooking vessels", "Marshall B.

When pork spare ribs or another meat is used instead, the dish is named accordingly. Galbi is served raw, then cooked on tabletop grills usually by the diners themselves. The dish may be marinated in a sweet and savory sauce usually containing soy sauce, garlic, and sugar. Both non-marinated and marinated galbi are often featured in Korean barbecue. This and many other dishes in Korean barbecue influenced Yakiniku as seen in the use of galbi (coined as karubi).\n\nPreparation\nCuts and marination\nTraditionally, galbi is cut to expose one smooth bone along the short edge with the meat uniformly filleted in flat layers.\nAn alternative cut, \"LA galbi\", also known as a flanken cut, features cut bones peeking out along the long edge. The method was developed by Korean immigrants in Los Angeles to accommodate the thinner rib-eye cut preferred by American butchers. The variation, which enables the marinade to penetrate the meat faster, has since made its way back to South Korea. Non-marinated galbi is called saeng-galbi (\uc0dd\uac08\ube44; \"fresh ribs\"); marinated galbi is referred to as yangnyeom-galbi (\uc591\ub150\uac08\ube44; \"seasoned ribs\"). Pork galbi is usually served marinated, but non-marinated dwaeji-saeng-galbi (\ub3fc\uc9c0\uc0dd\uac08\ube44; \"fresh pork ribs\"), made of Jeju Black pig, is popular in Jeju Island. As pork ribs are smaller, marinated dwaeji-galbi often consists of pork ribs mixed with shoulder meats.\n\nBeef\nSofter cuts of beef, such as from a cow or heifer, are preferred when grilling galbi. Properly grilled, the dish is a glossy, dark-reddish brown with a smoky, sweet taste. The meat should easily fall from the bones.The marinade for so-galbi-gui (\uc18c\uac08\ube44\uad6c\uc774; \"grilled beef ribs\") typically includes soy sauce, sugar, minced garlic and scallions, ginger juice, ground black pepper, toasted and ground sesame, and sesame oil. The beef is usually scored on the surface prior to marinating, and the juice from Korean pears is brushed on before grilling.\n\nPork\nFor dwaeji-galbi-gui (\ub3fc\uc9c0\uac08\ube44\uad6c\uc774; \"grilled pork ribs\"), the marinade can be either ganjang (soy sauce)-based or gochujang (chili paste)-based: the former being similar to beef galbi marinade and the latter being spicy. Cheongju (rice wine) is usually used in both types of marinade to remove any undesired porky smell.\nIf used, pork shoulder meat is carved into thicker slices of around 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) in width. Deeper cuts are made when scoring the surface to allow the marinade to penetrate the meat.\n\nGrilling and serving\nGalbi is grilled, typically by the diners themselves, on grills set in the tables. The meat cooks for a short time on medium high heat on a lightly greased gridiron over glowing charcoal. The remaining marinade is brushed on during grilling to produce a glazed finish.Once cooked, the meat is typically cut into pieces over the grill with kitchen scissors, then wrapped inside lettuce leaves, kkaennip (perilla leaves), or other leafy vegetables. These made-on-the-spot leaf wraps, called ssam, usually include a piece of grilled meat, ssamjang, raw or grilled garlic, and a sauce made of soybean paste and chili paste. Like other Korean main dishes, galbi is often accompanied by bap (cooked rice) and side dishes known as banchan.\n\nSee also\nKorean cuisine\nBulgogi \u2013 barbequed beef or pork\nDak-galbi \u2013 spicy stir-fried chicken\nGalbi-jjim \u2013 braised short ribs\nGalbi-tang \u2013 short rib soup\nKorean barbecue\nSamgyeopsal \u2013 grilled pork belly\nTteok-galbi \u2013 grilled short rib patties\nYakiniku \u2013 a similar Japanese dish\nAsado\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==", "pages": ["2008 US beef protest in South Korea", "Academic Press", "American bison", "Argentine beef", "Asado", "Balbacua", "Bamboo", "Banchan", "Bap (rice dish)", "Baseball steak", "Beef", "Beef Manhattan", "Beef Stroganoff", "Beef Wellington", "Beef aging", "Beef bourguignon", "Beef brain", "Beef bun", "Beef cattle", "Beef hormone controversy", "Beef noodle soup", "Beef olives", "Beef on weck", "Beef plate", "Beef ring", "Beef shank", "Beef tenderloin", "Beef tongue", "Beefalo", "Beefsteak", "Bistek", "Blade steak", "Blanquette de veau", "Boiled beef", "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy", "Bresaola", "Brisket", "Bruscitti", "Bulalo", "Bulgogi", "Cabeza", "Cachopo (dish)", "Calf's liver and bacon", "Cansi", "Carcass grade", "Chateaubriand (dish)", "Cheesesteak", "Cheongju (wine)", "Chicken-fried steak", "Chronicle Books", "Chuck steak", "Cordon bleu (dish)", "Corned beef", "Cow's trotters", "Cow\u2013calf operation", "Cut of beef", "Dak-galbi", "Darkcutter", "Daube", "Dendeng", "Doenjang", "Doopedia", "Doosan Corporation", "East Asia", "Encyclopedia of Korean Culture", "Fajita", "Feeder cattle", "Feu (food)", "Filet mignon", "Flank steak", "Flap steak", "Frankfurter Rindswurst", "French dip", "Galbi-jjim", "Galbi-tang", "Ginger beef", "Gochujang", "Gored gored", "Gridiron (cooking)", "Ground beef", "Gui (food)", "Gy\u016bdon", "Hamburg steak", "Hanger steak", "Hangul", "Hanu", "Hayashi rice", "Heart", "Hortob\u00e1gyi palacsinta", "Houston Press", "ISBN (identifier)", "Iga penyet", "Italian beef", "Jeju Black pig", "Jeju Island", "Jellied veal", "Jerky", "Kalio", "Kara\u0111or\u0111eva \u0161nicla", "Kare-kare", "Kitfo", "Kkaennip", "Kobe beef", "Korea", "Korean barbecue", "Korean cuisine", "Korean language", "Korean pear", "Leaf vegetable", "List of beef dishes", "List of cuisines", "List of steak dishes", "London broil", "Los Angeles", "Maeil Business Newspaper", "Marination", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Meat extract", "Meat on the bone", "Mechado", "Mongolian beef", "Montreal-style smoked meat", "NPR", "National Institute of Korean Language", "Neobiani", "Nilaga", "Offal", "Organic beef", "Osorno Steer", "Ossobuco", "Oxtail", "P'tcha", "Pares (food)", "Pastrami", "Pho", "Picanha", "Pot roast", "Pozharsky cutlet", "Puchero", "Ractopamine", "Ragout fin", "Ranch steak", "Rawon", "Rendang", "Restructured steak", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Rib eye steak", "Rib steak", "Roast beef", "Roast beef sandwich", "Rocky Mountain oysters", "Ropa vieja", "Round steak", "Rump steak", "Salisbury steak", "Saltimbocca", "Samgyeopsal", "Scallion", "Selat solo", "Sesame", "Sesame oil", "Sha cha beef", "Shooter's sandwich", "Short loin", "Short ribs", "Shoulder tender", "Sirloin steak", "Skirt steak", "Soup Number Five", "Soy sauce", "Spare ribs", "Sport Chosun", "Ssam", "Ssamjang", "Standing rib roast", "Steak Diane", "Steak and eggs", "Steak and kidney pudding", "Steak and oyster pie", "Steak au poivre", "Steak tartare", "Strip steak", "Suea rong hai", "T-bone steak", "Tafelspitz", "Tapa (Filipino cuisine)", "Tendon as food", "The Korea Herald", "The New York Times", "Tiyula itum", "Tongseng", "Top sirloin", "Tri-tip", "Tripas", "Tripe", "Tteok-galbi", "United States beef imports in Japan", "United States beef imports in South Korea", "United States beef imports in Taiwan", "Veal", "Veal Orloff", "Veal Oscar", "Veal milanese", "Vitello tonnato", "Wallenbergare", "Water buffalo", "Wikimedia Commons", "Yakiniku", "\u017bubro\u0144", "Template:Beef", "Template:Cite news", "Template talk:Beef", "Help:IPA/Korean", "Category:CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list"]}, "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015": {"body": "Gopchang-jeongol (\uacf1\ucc3d\uc804\uace8) or beef tripe hot pot is a spicy Korean stew or casserole made by boiling beef tripe, vegetables, and seasonings in beef broth. Gopchang refers to beef small intestines, while jeongol refers to a category of stew or casserole in Korean cuisine. Although the dish is mainly based on beef gopchang, other parts of beef innards are also used to give the dish a richer flavor and chewy texture.To remove any odor and excessive fat in the dish, any white fat adhering to the intestines should be meticulously cleaned out by rubbing them with wheat flour and salt and washing them several times. Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques and a great deal of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in beef innards dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entr\u00e9e, accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. It is often shared between several diners on the center of the table, and is also a popular anju when drinking alcoholic beverages such as soju in South Korea.\n\nIngredients\nKoreans classify beef innards into subcategories, which include yang (\uc591), beoljibyang (\ubc8c\uc9d1\uc591), cheonyeop (\ucc98\ub151), makchang (\ub9c9\ucc3d), gopchang (\uacf1\ucc3d, also called sochang \uc18c\ucc3d), and daechang (\ub300\ucc3d).\nThe first chamber of a beef stomach is called yang and is high in protein. It has been recommended for a person in weak health to drink the broth of yang since ancient times. The outer portion of the intestines is hard and lumpy, with a lot of black membranes and unclean materials attached between the projections, so those should be thoroughly cleaned out before cooking.\nGopchang (small intestines of cattle) is commonly referred to as such because of its curvy shape rather than as sochang, which literally means \"small intestines\". Compared to other cuts of meat, gopchang is high in iron and vitamins. It is relatively inexpensive and has a characteristic flavor and a chewy yet palatable texture, so it is used in many Korean dishes such as gui (grilled dishes) or bokkeum (stir-fried dishes).\nDaechang means \"large intestines\".\n\nPreparation\nThe broth for the dish can be either a mixture of two broths, made from beef gopchang and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by simmering beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef gopchang and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef gopchang has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef gopchang broth, cleaned beef gopchang, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed in a large pot with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef gopchang and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.Oyster mushrooms are parboiled in salted boiling water, slightly pressed to squeeze water, torn by their grain, and seasoned. Dried shiitake mushrooms are soaked in lukewarm water, and if a small amount of sugar is added to the water, that helps the mushrooms to rehydrate more quickly. The stipes of the mushroom are taken out, and the caps are shredded and seasoned. Green chili peppers are seeded and chopped and onions and carrots are chopped into pieces the same size as the peppers. Scallions are cut into long diagonal strips.In a pan, the remaining vegetables are placed on the bottom, and the marinated beef gopchang and brisket are placed over them in a circular fashion. The shredded mushrooms and sliced vegetables are arranged between the gopchang and meat. The prepared broths are mixed together, seasoned with salt, and poured little by little into the pan. When the dish is cooked, any floating foam is skimmed off and the gopchang jeongol is served.\n\nSee also\nTripe\nHaejangguk, soups eaten as a hangover remedy\nList of casserole dishes\nList of soups\nKorean cuisine\nList of Korean dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n(in Korean) \ubb38\ud654\uc18d\uc74c\uc2dd; \ub9cc\ud654 <\uc0ac\ub791\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5b4\ub3c4 \uba39\uace0 \uc0b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4> \uacf1\ucc3d\uc804\uace8 at Hankooki.com\n(in Korean) \uacbd\ub0a8\u00b7\uc6b8\uc0b0\uc758 \ub9db\uac70\ub9ac <48> \uc6b8\uc0b0 \ubb34\uac70\ub3d9 \uacf1\ucc3d\uac70\ub9ac at Kooje sinmun\n(in Korean) \uc774\ud604\uc8fc \uae30\uc790\uc758 \ub9db\uc9d1 \ub530\ub77c\uac00\uae30 \uae08\uace1\ub3d9 \u2018\uc81c\uc77c \uacf1\ucc3d\u2019 at Suwon ilbo", "pages": ["Anju (dish)", "Biological membrane", "Bokkeum", "Brisket", "Broth", "Casserole", "Chili pepper", "Dallas Observer", "Doosan Encyclopedia", "Entr\u00e9e", "Gomtang", "Gopchang", "Grain", "Gui (food)", "Haejangguk", "Hangul", "Iron", "Jeongol", "Korea", "Korean cuisine", "List of Korean dishes", "List of casserole dishes", "List of soups", "Maeil Kyungje", "McCune\u2013Reischauer", "Nate (web portal)", "National Institute of Korean Language", "Oyster mushroom", "Parboil", "Protein", "Rendering (food processing)", "Revised Romanization of Korean", "Scallion", "Shiitake", "Small intestine", "Soju", "South Korea", "Steamed rice", "Stew", "Stipe (mycology)", "Stir frying", "The Dong-a Ilbo", "Tripe", "Vitamin", "Wheat flour", "Wikipedia:Citation needed", "Wikipedia:Link rot", "Help:IPA/Korean", "Category:Articles with dead external links from March 2017", "Category:Articles with unsourced statements from March 2015"]}, "Portal:South Korea": {"body": "Korean barbecue (Korean: \uace0\uae30\uad6c\uc774, gogi-gui, 'meat roast') is a popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling meat, typically beef, pork or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining table itself. Some Korean restaurants that do not have built-in grills provide customers with portable stoves for diners to use at their tables. Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes that are made to order.\nThe most representative form of gogi-gui is bulgogi, usually made from thinly sliced marinated beef sirloin or tenderloin. Another popular form is galbi, made from marinated beef short ribs. However, gogi-gui also includes many other kinds of marinated and unmarinated meat dishes, and can be divided into several categories. Korean barbecue is popular in its home country. It gained its global popularity through Hallyu, more commonly known as the \"Korean Wave\",  a term that describes the rise in popularity of Korean culture during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nVarieties\nMarinated barbecue meats\nBulgogi is the most popular variety of Korean barbecue. Before cooking, the meat is marinated with a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, ginger, scallions, sesame oil, garlic and pepper. Pears are also traditionally used in the marinade to help tenderize the meat, but kiwi and pineapple have also been used more recently. It is traditionally cooked using gridirons or perforated dome griddles that sit on braziers, but pan cooking has become common as well.Galbi is made with beef short ribs, marinated in a sauce that may contain mirin, soy sauce, water, garlic, brown sugar, sugar and sliced onions. It is believed to taste best when grilled with charcoal or soot (\uc22f, burned wood chips).Jumulleok is short steak marinated with sesame oil, salt and pepper. It is similar to unmarinated gogi-gui, distinguished it from other kinds of meat by its steak-like juicy texture. Jumulleok is also commonly found with sliced duck instead of beef.\nDwaeji bulgogi, or spicy pork, is also a popular gogigui dish. It is different from beef bulgogi in that the marinade is not soy sauce-based, but, instead, is marinated in sauces based on gochujang and/or gochu garu (Korean chili powder). The flavor is usually better when made with fattier cuts of pork, such as pork shoulder or pork belly.\n\nUn-marinated barbecue meats\nChadolbagi or chadolbaegi is a dish made from thinly sliced beef brisket, which is not marinated. It is so thin that it cooks nearly instantly as soon as it is dropped onto a heated pan.\nSamgyeopsal is made of thicker strips of unsalted pork belly. It has fatty areas and is tender. In Korea, samgyeopsal is eaten more frequently than chadolbaegi due to the comparatively lower price of pork.\n\nLoins (deungsim, \ub4f1\uc2ec) and boneless ribs (galbisal, \uac08\ube44\uc0b4) are also a popular choice as an unmarinated type of gogigui.\n\nSide dishes\nGogi-gui comes with various banchan (side dishes). The most popular side dishes are rice and kimchi, and a green onion salad called pajeori and a fresh vegetable dish including lettuce, cucumbers, and peppers invariably accompany the meat dishes at restaurants. Other popular side dishes include the spinach side dish (sigeumchi namul/\uc2dc\uae08\uce58\ub098\ubb3c), egg roll omelette (gyeran-mari/\uacc4\ub780\ub9d0\uc774), spicy radish salad (mu saengchae/\ubb34\uc0dd\ucc44), and a steamed egg souffl\u00e9 (gyeran-jjim/\uacc4\ub780\ucc1c).
