        "body": "Ricciarelli are traditional Italian biscuits \u2013 specifically, a type of macaroon \u2013 originating in 14th century Siena. It is considered one of the signature sweets of Siena, in addition to panforte, cenci,:\u200a167\u200a and cavallucci.\n\nBackground\nLegend holds that they were introduced by Ricciardetto della Gherardesca in his castle near Volterra upon his return from the Crusades.:\u200a169\u200a He purportedly said that the \"foreign biscuits curled like the Sultan's slippers\".:\u200a169\u200a The modern biscuit does not exhibit curling.:\u200a14\u200a In medieval times, they were known as marzapanetti alla senese or morzelletti.:\u200a38\u200a They acquired the name ricciarelli in the 1800s.:\u200a38\u200aAn alternative etymology, from the Treccani Italian dictionary, indicates that the word ricciar\u00e8lli derives from r\u00ecccio, meaning 'hedgehog', perhaps for the original form. Particularly when coated with sliced almonds, the biscuit looks like a hedgehog.\n\nPreparation\nToday, the biscuits are made using an almond base:\u200a169\u200a with sugar, honey and egg white. When prepared in the traditional method, the almonds are ground with a milling machine, and the finished mix is formed into numerous oval- or lozenge-shaped biscuits:\u200a169\u200a of about 20 grams (0.71 oz) each:\u200a39\u200a that are set aside for two days before baking. After baking, they are removed from the oven and allowed to cool for 15 minutes, to prevent the biscuits from breaking, before transferring them to wire racks.:\u200a179\u200a They may be baked with rice paper, which is trimmed to the shape of the biscuit after they have cooled.:\u200a179\u200a The rough and crackled surface is usually lightly sprinkled with confectioner's sugar, and may also be covered in dark chocolate.:\u200a151\u200aRicciarelli are typically consumed at Christmas, served with a dessert wine such as Vin Santo:\u200a151\u200a or Moscadello di Montalcino.\nPackaged biscuits sold at retail are traditionally enveloped in a blue paper tissue depicting two winged horses from the Etruscan Archeological Museum in Volterra.:\u200a151\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Wibele are very small, sweet biscuits originating from the Franconian city of Langenburg in Germany, though nowadays they are considered a Swabian speciality. The dough is made from egg white, icing sugar, flour and vanilla sugar. They are similar to \"Russisch Brot\" (\"Russian bread\"), another form of German biscuit, but instead are only baked until they are slightly brown. They are in the shape of a figure 8, and are formally supposed to be 22 millimeters long and 12 millimeters wide.\nThey were invented by the court cook of the prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Jakob Christian Carl Wibel. Caf\u00e9 Bauer in Langenburg is the only company allowed to produce \"Original Wibele\", as the owner secured the rights in 1911.

        "body": "Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, made out of fillet steak coated with p\u00e2t\u00e9 (often p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras) and duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a cr\u00eape or dry-cured ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy.\nA whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions before wrapping and baking.\n\nNaming\nWhile historians generally believe that the dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, the precise origin of the name is unclear and no definite connection between the dish and the duke has been found.Leah Hyslop, writing in The Daily Telegraph, observed that by the time Wellington became famous, meat baked in pastry was a well-established part of English cuisine, and that the dish's similarity to the French filet de b\u0153uf en cro\u00fbte (fillet of beef in pastry) might imply that \"beef Wellington\" was a \"timely patriotic rebranding of a trendy continental dish\". However, she cautioned, there are no 19th-century recipes for the dish. There is a mention of \"fillet of beef, \u00e0 la Wellington\" in the Los Angeles Times of 1903, and an 1899 reference in a menu from the Hamburg-America line.In the Polish classic cookbook, finished in 1909 and published for the first time in 1910, by Maria Ochorowicz-Monatowa (1866-1925), Uniwersalna ksi\u0105\u017cka kucharska (\"The Universal Cooking Book\"), there is a recipe for \"Pol\u0119dwica wo\u0142owa \u00e0 la Wellington\" (beef fillet \u00e0 la Wellington). The recipe does not differ from the dish later known under this name. It is a beef filet enveloped together with duxelles in puff pastry, baked, and served with a truffle or Madeira sauce. The author, who mastered her cooking skills both in Paris and Vienna at the end of the 19th century, claimed that she had received this recipe from the cook of the imperial court in Vienna. She also included \"filet \u00e0 la Wellington\" in the menus proposed for the \"exquisite dinners\".In Le R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine a professional reference cookbook published by Th\u00e9odore Gringoire and Louis Saulnier in 1914, there is mentioned a garnish \"Wellington\" to beef, described as: \"Fillet browned in butter and in the oven, coated in poultry stuffing with dry duxelles added, placed in rolled-out puff pastry. Cooked in the oven. Garnished with peeled tomatoes,lettuce, Pommes ch\u00e2teau\".\nAn installment of a serialized story entitled \"Custom Built\" by Sidney Herschel Small in 1930 had two of its characters in a restaurant in Los Angeles that had \"beef Wellington\" on its menu. The first occurrence of the dish recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary is a quotation from a 1939 New York food guide with \"Tenderloin of Beef Wellington\" which is cooked, left to cool, and rolled in a pie crust.\n\nVariations\nIn the Food Network show Good Eats, Alton Brown discusses a variant using the cheaper pork tenderloin instead of beef.\n\nSee also\nShooter's sandwich\nList of beef dishes\nList of steak dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Palmero cheese (Sp: queso palmero or queso de La Palma) is a Spanish plain or lightly smoked cheese from the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is made of unpasteurised goats milk and has Denomination of Origin protection. The goats are free to graze on natural wild plants which are available all year round. The cheese is made on many small farms all over the island. It is presented in cylindrical cheeses of up to 15 kilos (33 lbs).\n\nManufacture\nThe milk is collected after milking and coagulated before it has cooled, around 27 to 33C (80-91 \u00b0F), with natural rennet from goat kids. The coagulation usually takes about 45 minutes, after which the curd is cut into small grains to facilitate the drainage of the whey. The curd is then put into moulds and pressed and then left to drain. After this the cheeses are salted on the exterior with dry sea salt collected on the island. Some cheese is sold as fresh and some is smoked. The smoking is carried out using local materials such as almond shells, dried cactus or canarian pine. Following the smoking the cheeses are left to mature in local caves or air-conditioned rooms standing on plastic mesh which imparts a pattern on the rind. The cheeses are turned regularly and the rinds are rubbed with olive oil or gofio to protect them.\n\nFlavour\nThe flavour is clean and characteristic of goat milk and a natural coagulation with a slight acidity and slight saltiness. The smoked cheese has a very slight smoky taste.\n\nTexture\nIn fresh cheese it is soft and shiny white. In more mature cheese it is firm but elastic and of an ivory-white to pale cream colour. The cheese cuts cleanly but very small cavities evenly spread through the cheese may be visible.\n\nRind\nThe rind on fresh cheese is very thin. On mature cheese it is of medium thickness and the whole of the flat faces are usually marked with a grid of small squares. The colour can vary from a pale beige-cream to light or medium brown, depending on the maturity and smoking method.\n\nUses\nPalmero cheese is eaten thinly sliced and unprepared or it may be grilled and eaten with the local mojo sauce.\n\nSee also\nList of smoked foods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Chicken Kiev, also known as chicken Kyiv, is a dish made of chicken fillet pounded and rolled around cold butter, then coated with egg and bread crumbs, and either fried or baked. Since fillets are often referred to as supr\u00eames in professional cookery, the dish is also called \"supr\u00eame de volaille \u00e0 la Kiev\". Stuffed chicken breast is generally known in Russian and Ukrainian cuisines as c\u00f4telette de volaille. Though it has disputed origins, the dish is particularly popular in the post-Soviet states, as well as in several other countries of the former Eastern Bloc, and in the English-speaking world.\n\nHistory\nThe history of this dish is not well documented, and various sources make claims about its origin. Since the 18th century, Russian chefs have adopted many techniques of French haute cuisine and combined them with the local culinary tradition. The adoption was furthered by the French chefs, such as Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame and Urbain Dubois, who were hired by Russian gentry. In particular, the use of high quality meat cuts, such as various cutlets, steaks, escalopes and supr\u00eames became widespread in the 19th century, and a number of original dishes involving such components were developed in Russia at that time.\n\nC\u00f4telette de volaille\nThe French term de volaille means \"of poultry\" and denotes almost exclusively chicken dishes in French cookbooks. The name c\u00f4telette de volaille means thus simply \"chicken cutlet\". Despite the original French name, the Russian recipe is unknown in French cuisine, where the term c\u00f4telette de volaille refers to chicken breasts in general and is used nearly synonymously with chicken filet or supr\u00eame. The French term also denotes a minced chicken cutlet-shaped patty. The general Russian term for chicken cutlets, kurinaya kotleta (\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430), refers predominantly to such minced cutlets, whereas kotleta de-voliay (\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0439) is applied exclusively to the stuffed chicken breast dish. The latter name appears in the pre- and post-revolutionary Russian literature (in cookbooks as well as in fiction) since the beginning of the 20th century and is usually mentioned as a common restaurant dish.The recipe in the classical Russian cookery textbook The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva (which had eleven editions between 1899 and 1916) includes a complex stuffing similar to quenelle (a mixture of minced meat, in this case the rest of the meat of the chicken, and cream) but with butter added. It also points out that \"the cutlets de volaille are made from whole chicken fillets, like the game cutlets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\". The recipe is preceded by a similar one for \"hazel grouse cutlets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" with a quenelle and truffle stuffing. Another Russian cookbook published at the same time gives basically identical recipes for c\u00f4telette de volaille and c\u00f4telette \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale and notes that the only difference between them is that the former are made of chicken while the latter are made of game, such as hazel grouse, blackcock, etc.The term \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale (\"marshal-style\") denotes in French cookery tender pieces of meat, such as cutlets, escalopes, sweetbreads, or chicken breasts, which are treated \u00e0 l'anglaise (\"English-style\"), i.e. coated with egg and breadcrumbs, and saut\u00e9ed. Numerous recipes of such dishes, some of them with stuffings, are described in both Western and Russian cookbooks of the 19th century. Among the stuffed versions, one finds a recipe for a \"fowl fillet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" stuffed with truffles and herbs in The Art of French Cuisine of the 19th Century (1847) by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, and a similar filet de poulets \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale with herbs and forcemeat in La cuisine classique (1868) by Urbain Dubois. Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, the most successful Russian cookbook of the 19th century, has included since its first edition in 1861 an elaborate recipe for \"hazel grouse \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" stuffed with Madeira sauce, portobello mushrooms and truffles.\n\nPozharsky cutlet\nThe main difference between the old time c\u00f4telette de volaille and the modern chicken Kiev is that the elaborate stuffings of the former are replaced by butter. The use of butter for chicken cutlets has been known in Russian cuisine at least since the invention of the Pozharsky cutlet in the first half of the 19th century. The Pozharsky cutlets are breaded ground chicken patties for which butter is added to minced meat. This results in an especially juicy and tender consistency. The dish was a widely appraised invention of 19th-century Russian cuisine, which was also adopted by French haute cuisine and subsequently by the international cuisine.While the roots of chicken Kiev can thus be traced back to French haute cuisine and Russian cookery of the 19th century, the origin of the particular recipe known today as chicken Kiev remains disputed.\n\nIndividual attributions\nThe Russian Tea Room Cookbook notes that chicken Kiev was \"most likely ... a creation of the great French chef Car\u00eame at the Court of Alexander I.\" Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame spent just several months of the year 1818 in St. Petersburg, but made a profound impact on Russian cuisine in this short time. The reforms carried out by his followers introduced in particular various meat cuts into Russian cookery. The recipe of the Russian c\u00f4telette de volaille is not present in Car\u00eame's major work mentioned above, but his \"fowl fillet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\" could have served as the starting point for the further development of such dishes.\nSome Russian sources attribute the creation of this dish (or of its precursor) to Nicolas Appert, French confectioner and chef, best known as the inventor of airtight food preservation. In contrast, common biographic sources for Appert do not mention this dish, and the origin of these claims is unclear.\n\nNovo-Mikhailovsky cutlet\nRussian food historian William Pokhlyobkin claimed that chicken Kiev was invented in 1912 as Novo-Mikhailovskaya kotleta in \u0430 St. Petersburg Merchants' Club located near the Mikhailovsky palace, and was renamed kotleta po-kiyevski in 1947 by a Soviet restaurant. However, these claims collide with primary sources. The cookbook by Alexandrova-Ignatieva (including editions before and after 1912) describes indeed Novo-Mikhailovsky cutlets and mentions that they were invented in the club near the Mikhailovsky palace. However, in the provided recipe these cutlets are made from minced meat similarly to the Pozharsky cutlet, with the only difference being the meat pounded by a tenderizer until it gets minced. This allows one to remove tendons from the meat and results in a more tender consistency of the ground meat than after the use of a grinder. The author also remarks that not only breasts but also other parts of chicken can be prepared this way and added to the mixture of meat and butter.The second claim of Pokhlyobkin's version is invalidated, as the references of chicken Kiev appeared in published sources much earlier, since the 1910s.\n\nModern chicken Kiev\nOral tradition in Kyiv attributes the invention of the \"cutlet de volaille Kiev-style\" (kot\u0142eta de-voljaj po-kyjiv\u015bky) to the restaurant of the Continental hotel in Kyiv in the beginning of the 20th century. A luxury hotel built in 1897 in the center of Kyiv, it was run until the Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The building was then mined by the retreating Red Army and exploded when the German Army occupied Kyiv in September 1941. After the war, the building was rebuilt and has since then been used by the Kyiv Conservatory. According to the memoirs of contemporaries, Chicken Kiev was the signature dish of the hotel's restaurant.\nAn early reference of \"Kiev cutlets from chicken or veal\" is found in the Cookery Digest (1915), a collection of recipes which were published in the Moscow Journal for Housewives in 1913\u20131914. These were minced meat cutlets similar to the Pozharsky cutlets, but shaped like a croquette with a bar of cold butter placed in the middle. Like modern chicken Kiev, the croquettes were covered with egg and breadcrumbs and fried.Later, \"chicken cutlets Kiev-style\" were listed in Apportionments for dinners, separate dishes and other products of public catering (1928) which served as a standard reference for Soviet catering establishments. The book also included other items for chicken cutlets, such as \"cutlet de volaille\" and \"cutlet \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale\". The book demanded renaming of many traditional restaurant dishes to replace the (mostly French-style) \"bourgeois\" names with simple \"proletarian\" forms. In particular, the \"cutlet Kiev-style\" had to be renamed into \"chicken cutlet stuffed with butter\". This program was not realised immediately (at least not completely), and its successor, The Directory of Apportionments for Catering (1940), published by the Soviet Ministry of Food Industry, still included the traditional names. In post-World War II publications of this directory and in other Soviet cookery books, such as Cookery (1955), the \"Kiev-style\" name was retained, but the terms de volaille and \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale were indeed dropped in favour of simple names such as \"chicken cutlet stuffed with milk sauce\", \"chicken cutlet stuffed with liver\" and \"chicken cutlet stuffed with chicken quenelle and mushrooms\". As a result of this policy, the names de volaille and \u00e0 la Mar\u00e9chale disappeared from menus of Soviet restaurants.\nThe \"old-style\" name \"cutlet de volaille Kiev-style\" was occasionally mentioned in some post-World War II Soviet fiction books. In particular, in a short story This Is Not Written In A Cookbook (1947) by Yevgeny Vorobyov, a Soviet soldier and a former chef in a Moscow noble hotel explains to his comrade in arms, that \"cutlets de volaille are made for two tastes. There are cutlets de volaille Kiev-style and cutlets de volaille jardiniere.\"The name kotlet de volaille is used to this day for chicken Kiev in Poland. The name is oftentimes polonised as dewolaj (dewolaje for plural).Mentions of chicken Kiev are also found in US newspapers starting from 1937. The reports describe the Russian-style restaurant Yar in Chicago serving this dish. The restaurant existed until 1951 and was run by Vladimir Yaschenko, a former colonel of the imperial Russian army. It was styled after the famous eponymous Moscow restaurant and was frequented by celebrities of that time. After World War II, US newspapers mentioned chicken Kiev served in New York restaurants. Recipes for a \"chicken cutlet \u00e0 la Kiev\" were published in The New York Times in 1946 and in Gourmet magazine in 1948.Since the end of the 1940s or beginning of the 1950s, chicken Kiev became a standard fare in Soviet high class restaurants, in particular in the Intourist hotel chain serving foreign tourists. Tourist booklets warned the diners of the danger it presented to their clothing. At the same time the popularity of this dish grew in the US. According to Darra Goldstein chicken Kiev became \"a symbol of Russian haute cuisine\".In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, supermarket chains in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada rebranded their versions of the dish to \"chicken Kyiv\" (in line with the general media shift from the Russian-derived name \"Kiev\" to \"Kyiv\") to show respect and support for Ukraine and Ukrainians.\n\nVariants\nChicken Kiev is made from a boned and skinned breast which is cut lengthwise, pounded and stuffed with butter. Western recipes usually call for garlic butter, while in Russian ones regular butter is used. Herbs (parsley and dill) can be added to the butter. In some American recipes butter is replaced by blue cheese.In the classical preparation of French c\u00f4telettes de volaille, the humerus bone of the wing is left attached. This also holds for their Russian versions and in particular for chicken Kiev. For serving, the bone is usually covered with a frilled paper napkin. However, industrially produced pure fillets are often used nowadays, and the cutlets are served without the bone. This is the usual way of serving chicken Kiev in the US. A spherically shaped version was developed by English chef Jesse Dunford Wood.\n\nConvenience food\nIn the middle of the 20th century, semi-processed ground meat cutlets were introduced in the USSR. Colloquially known as Mikoyan cutlets (named after Soviet politician Anastas Mikoyan), these were cheap pork or beef cutlet-shaped patties which resembled industrially produced American beef burgers. Some varieties bore names of well known Russian restaurant dishes but they had little in common with the original dishes. In particular, a variety of a pork patty was called \"Kiev-style cutlet\". Since the late Soviet times, \"real\" chicken Kiev cutlets have been offered in Russia as convenience food.Introduced in Britain during 1979, chicken Kiev was Marks & Spencer company's first ready-made meal. It remains popular in the UK, being readily available in supermarkets and served in some restaurant chains. Due to its popularity, it is included in the UK inflation basket which is composed by the Office for National Statistics for calculations of the consumer price inflation indices. The wide popularity of chicken Kiev as a pre-packaged meal led to the term Kiev being applied to various stuffed chicken dishes, such as \"leek-and-bacon Kiev\" or \"cheese-and-ham Kiev\" (the same dish as chicken cordon bleu). Vegetarian Kievs were introduced in the UK in the 1990s, and are popular vegetarian convenience foods.\n\nSimilar dishes\nAmong other dishes similar to chicken Kiev, the aforementioned chicken cordon bleu with a cheese and ham filling instead of butter is particularly popular in the West. The recipe of Kara\u0111or\u0111eva \u0161nicla, a Serbian breaded veal or pork cutlet, was inspired by chicken Kiev.\n\nCultural references\n\"'Chicken Kiev' speech\" is the derisive name coined by William Safire for then-U.S. President George H. W. Bush's speech in Kyiv on 1 August 1991, which opposed independence for Ukraine, cautioning Ukrainians against \"suicidal nationalism\". Bush did what he could diplomatically to keep the Soviet Union together, but on 24 August Ukraine declared independence, and on 1 December Ukrainians voted for it in a national referendum, leading to the USSR's dissolution by December 26.\nIn 2018, a bronze miniature sculpture of chicken Kiev was placed on Horodecki street in Kyiv, near the restaurant \"Chicken Kyiv\". The sculpture became the first of a set of such mini-sculptures depicting famous symbols of Kyiv placed throughout the city as part of an art project.\n\nSee also\nBreaded cutlet\nList of chicken dishes\nList of Russian dishes\nUkrainian cuisine\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n\u041f. \u0412. \u0410\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432; et al.

Jaggery, spices, and nuts are added to it to give it flavor. It is chilled and served as dessert. Rabri is the main ingredient in several desserts, such as rasabali, chhena kheeri, and khira sagara. \nA similar dish goes by the name Basundi.\n\nHistory\nChandimangala mentions rabdi (thickened, sweetened milk), along with other sweets, in the early 1400s.Rabri was banned in Kolkata 1965 during an economic recession for its excessive use of milk. It was overturned within the year by the Calcutta High Court due to lawsuits from independent sweet shops.\n\nCreation\nRabri is made by heating sweetened milk in a large open vessel (kadhai). As the layer of cream begins to form on the surface of the milk, it is taken off and kept aside. The process continues until the milk is exhausted.\n\nSee also\nBasundi, a similar dish\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Nabisco (, abbreviated from the earlier name National Biscuit Company) is an American manufacturer of cookies and snacks headquartered in East Hanover, New Jersey. The company is a subsidiary of Illinois-based Mondel\u0113z International.Nabisco's 1,800,000-square-foot (170,000 m2) plant in Chicago is the largest bakery in the world, employing more than 1,200 workers and producing around 320 million pounds (150 million kilograms) of snack foods annually. Its products include Chips Ahoy!, Belvita, Oreo cookies, Ritz Crackers, Teddy Grahams, Triscuit crackers, Fig Newtons, and Wheat Thins for the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, and other parts of South America.\nAll Nabisco cookie or cracker products are branded Christie in Canada, after Canadian baker William Mellis Christie. Christie's flagship bakery in Toronto was demolished after Mondel\u0113z shut it down in 2013. Nabisco opened corporate offices as the National Biscuit Company in the Home Insurance Building in the Chicago Loop in 1898, the world's first skyscraper.\n\nHistory\nPearson & Sons Bakery opened in Massachusetts in 1792, and they made a biscuit called pilot bread for consumption on long sea voyages. In 1889, William H. Moore acquired Pearson & Sons Bakery, Josiah Bent Bakery, and six other bakeries to start the New York Biscuit Company. Chicago lawyer Adolphus Green (1843\u20131917) started the American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company in 1890 after acquiring 40 different bakeries. Then Moore, Green, and John Gottlieb Zeller (1849\u20131939, founder of Richmond Steam Bakery) all merged in 1898 to form the \"National Biscuit Company\", and Green was named president. Zeller was president of National Biscuit Company from 1923\u20131931.\nNabisco celebrated its golden anniversary in 1948, and Nabisco had become the corporate name by 1971. In 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands to form \"Nabisco Brands\", which merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1985 to form RJR Nabisco. Kraft General Foods acquired the Nabisco cold cereals from RJR Nabisco in 1993, and the cereal brands are now owned by Post Holdings. In 1999, Nabisco acquired Favorite Brands International. In 2000, Philip Morris Companies Inc. acquired Nabisco and merged it with Kraft Foods in one of the largest mergers in the food industry. In 2011, Kraft Foods announced that it was splitting into a grocery company and a snack food company. Nabisco became part of the snack-food business, which took the name Mondel\u0113z International.The first use of the name Nabisco was in a cracker brand produced by National Biscuit Company in 1901. The firm later introduced Fig Newtons, Nabisco Wafers, Anola Wafers, Barnum's Animal Crackers (1902), Cameos (1910), Lorna Doones (1912), Oreos (1912), and Famous Chocolate Wafers (1924, which would be discontinued in 2023).In 1924, the National Biscuit Company introduced a snack in a sealed packet called the Peanut Sandwich Packet. They soon added the Sorbetto Sandwich Packet. These allowed salesmen to sell to soda fountains, road stands, milk bars, lunch rooms, and news stands. Sales increased, and the company started to use the name NAB in 1928. The term Nabs today is used to generically mean any type of snack crackers, most commonly in the southern US.As of July 16, 2021, parent company Mondel\u0113z International made the decision to close the Fair Lawn plant after 63 years forcing the majority of the 600 employees to move on and/or retire, accept jobs with other businesses or transfer within the company.In August 2021, over 1,000 workers at several bakeries and distribution centers throughout the United States, organized under the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union, went on strike over disagreements regarding a new labor contract with Nabisco.\n\nMergers and acquisitions\nAcquisitions\nThe National Biscuit Company acquired the Shredded Wheat Company, maker of Triscuit and Shredded Wheat cereal, and Christie, Brown & Company of Toronto in 1928, but all of the Nabisco cookie and cracker products in Canada still use the name Christie. It also acquired F.H. Bennett Company, maker of Milk-Bone dog biscuits, in 1931.\nIn 1981, Nabisco merged with Standard Brands, maker of Planters Nuts, Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars, Royal gelatin, Fleischmann's and Blue Bonnet margarines, amongst others. The company was then renamed Nabisco Brands, Inc. At that time, it also acquired the Life Savers brand from the E.R. Squibb Company, makers of Bubble Yum & Care-free gum. Commercials were revised as a result of the merger by January 1983.\n\nR. J. Reynolds merger\nIn 1985, Nabisco was bought by R.J. Reynolds, forming \"RJR Nabisco\". After three years of mixed results, the company became one of the hotspots in the 1980s leveraged buyout mania. The company was in auction with two bidders: F. Ross Johnson, the company's president and CEO, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a private equity partnership.\nThe company was sold to KKR in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout in history, described in the book Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, and a subsequent film.\n\nSubsequent acquisitions and divestitures\nIn 1989, RJR Nabisco Inc. sold its Chun King foods division to Yeo Hiap Seng Limited and Fullerton Holdings Pte. Ltd for $52 million to reduce its debt from its $24.5 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.In December 1989, RJR Nabisco sold its Del Monte canned fruits and vegetables business in South America to Polly Peck International PLC. One year later, in 1990 RJR Nabisco sold Curtiss Candy, which owned the Baby Ruth and Butterfinger brands, to Nestl\u00e9. RJR also sold LU, Belin and other European biscuit brands to Groupe Danone, only reunited in 2007 after Nabisco's present parent, Kraft Foods, bought Danone's biscuit operations for EUR 5.3 billion.In 1994, RJR sold its breakfast cereal business (primarily the Shredded Wheat franchise) to Kraft Foods Inc. and the international licenses to General Mills, which later became part of the Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture with Nestl\u00e9.Also in 1994, RJR acquired Rose Knox's Knox gelatin and integrated the Shredded wheat franchise into the Post Foods portfolio. Post continues to sell the product today.\nIn 1995, Nestl\u00e9 agreed to buy the Ortega Mexican foods business from Nabisco Inc. That same year, RJR-Nabisco also acquired the North American margarine and table spreads business of Kraft foods. This purchase included Parkay, Touch of Butter and Chiffon.In 1998, Nabisco Holdings announced its sale of its margarine and egg substitute business to ConAgra. In 1997, the brands of Fleishmann's, Blue Bonnet and Parkay had sales of $480 million. It also sold its College Inn broth brand to HJ Heinz and its Venezuelan Del Monte operations to Del Monte Foods.In 1999, RJR Nabisco's food and tobacco empire fell apart when they sold its international tobacco division to Japan Tobacco for $7.8 billion.In 2000 Nabisco Holdings together with several investors (as Finalrealm) acquired United Biscuits, As part of the transaction, United Biscuits acquired Nabisco's European businesses and divested Far East (China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) business to Nabisco. Nabisco became a leading shareholder in United Biscuits (the position that inherited by Kraft Foods until 2006).\nThe Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) acquired Nabisco (sans Bubble Yum which was sold to Hershey) in 2000 for about $19.2 billion. Philip Morris then combined Nabisco with Kraft. That acquisition was approved by the Federal Trade Commission subject to the divestiture of products in five areas: three Jell-O and Royal brands types of products (dry-mix gelatin dessert, dry-mix pudding, no-bake desserts), intense mints (such as Altoids), and baking powder. Kraft Foods, at the time also a subsidiary of Altria, merged with Nabisco.In 2006, Nabisco sold its Milk-Bone pet snacks to Del Monte Foods Co. for $580 million.Kraft Foods was spun off from Altria, taking its Nabisco subsidiary with it, in 2007. In January 2007, Cream of Wheat was sold to B&G Foods.\n\nLegal battles\nIn 1997, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus became concerned with an ad campaign for Planters Deluxe Mixed Nuts. The initial commercial featured a man and monkey deserted on an island. They discover a crate of Planters peanuts and rejoice in the peanuts' positive health facts.\nNabisco made a detailed statement describing how their peanuts were healthier than most other snack products, going as far as comparing the nutritional facts of Planters peanuts to those of potato chips, Cheddar cheese chips, and popcorn. Technically, the commercials complied with United States Food and Drug Administration regulations, and they were allowed to continue. However, as requested by the National Advertising Division, Nabisco agreed to make fat content disclosure more conspicuous in future commercials.The company's A1 Steak Sauce was the subject of a legal battle against a venue called Arnie's Deli in 1991. The delicatessen was selling and using a homemade sauce called \"A2 Sauce.\" The verdict favored Nabisco.\n\nBrands and products\nCorporate image\nNabisco's trademark is a diagonal ellipse with a series of antenna-like lines protruding from the top (\"Orb and Cross\" or Globus cruciger). It forms the base of its logo and can be seen imprinted on Oreo cookies, in addition to Nabisco product boxes and literature. The trademark is derived from a medieval Venetian printer's mark that represented \"the triumph of the moral and spiritual over the evil and the material\". A symbol previously used to represent Christ's redemption of the world.The current update of the familiar Nabisco trademark was designed by American typographer and graphic designer Gerard Huerta, who has created many famous logos for corporate identity and branding as well as the movie and music industries, such as AC/DC's.\n\nSponsorship\nFrom 2002\u20132005, Nabisco and Kraft jointly sponsored both Dale Earnhardt, Inc., and Roush Racing. Earnhardt Jr. won four races in a row at Daytona International Speedway with Nabisco sponsorship. Kraft and Nabisco sponsored a part-time Sprint Cup effort in car #81 driven by Jason Keller and John Andretti and fielded by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Nabisco also sponsored Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the 2010 Subway Jalape\u00f1o 250 at Daytona International Speedway in July 2010 with their Oreo/Ritz brands and Tony Stewart with the Ritz brand in the 2010 DRIVE4COPD 300 at Daytona International Speedway in 2010.\n\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website  (Snack Worlds.com)\nFTC summary of competitive concerns about the 2000 acquisition of Nabisco\nHistoric Nabisco factory in Detroit",

        "body": "Tirggel are traditional Christmas biscuits from Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Made from flour and honey, they are thin, hard, and sweet.\n\nHistory\nTirggel are first recorded in Z\u00fcrich as Dirgel in 1461. They have been manufactured there ever since with elaborately carved wooden moulds depicting Biblical or regional themes. More recently, the wooden moulds\u2014four of which are exhibited in the Swiss National Museum\u2014have been replaced by polycarbonate casts, which are easier to handle.\n\nPreparation\nTirggel dough is composed of flour, 29 percent honey, some sugar and water; although one source reports that it is or was made without sugar, which is taken to be an indication of the tirggel's pre-Christian origins.The dough is pressed very thinly into elaborately carved moulds of varying shapes and sizes. The biscuits are baked in a high-temperature oven at 400 \u00b0C (752 \u00b0F) for only 90 seconds and require good timing to get right.\n\nConsumption\nBecause tirggel are hard and dry, they are best when sucked on for a while, which allows the honey flavour to become more pronounced.Tirggel are also very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger reported in 1939 that \"the tirggel has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it to nibble on.\" On account of their elaborate ornamentation, traditionally manufactured tirggel are often not eaten at all for months or years and are kept as decorations instead.\n\nSee also\nCulinary Heritage of Switzerland\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nOtt, Ernst (1967). \"Der Tirggel\".

        "body": "A bean pie is a sweet custard pie whose filling consists of mashed beans, usually navy bean, sugar, eggs, milk, butter and spices. Common spices and flavorings include vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Variations can include cloves, ginger, pumpkin pie spice and lemon extract.\nBean pies are now commonly associated with African American Muslims' cuisine as an alternative to soul foods, except those containing vanilla extract or imitation vanilla extract as they contain alcohol. The pies are also specifically associated with the Nation of Islam movement and Elijah Muhammad, who encouraged their consumption instead of certain ingredients associated with soul food.Members of the community commonly sell bean pies as part of their fundraising efforts. The bean pie was allegedly introduced by Wallace Fard Muhammad, who was a restaurateur in the 1910s and 1920s prior to founding the Nation of Islam in 1930. However, in 1884 a recipe for bean pie was published in the New Kentucky Home Cook Book, contributed by Lucy Keith and compiled by the ladies of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Maysville, Kentucky. According to her obituary, \"she was a typical daughter of the old South, noted for her kindness and charity and was a life long member of the M.E. Church, South.\"\n\nSee also\nList of custard desserts\nList of pies, tarts and flans\nPie in American cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Examples are Linzer Stangerl or Linzer Kipferl, which are named after the Austrian city of Linz. \nThe most common UK version was popularised by Mr Kipling, consisting of two biscuits sandwiched with buttercream and jam. In this sense they resemble the older Empire biscuit.\nOther varieties can have a single layer with chocolate piping.\nThere can be many different ways to make the shape of them (like into straight lines or finger shaped) and many different ways to pipe them. They can be dipped in chocolate or any other dipping.Viennese whirls can also have different kinds of fillings piped or spread into them.

        "body": "Serradura (Portuguese pronunciation: [s\u0250\u0281\u0250\u02c8du\u027e\u0250]), also known as sawdust pudding or Macau pudding, is a well-known Portuguese dessert, popular in both Portugal and Macau (a former Portuguese colony in China), as well as Goa (a former Portuguese colony in India), with a layered appearance alternating between whipped cream and crumbled Marie biscuit.\nThe name serradura is a Portuguese word for \u201csawdust\u201d, which refers to the way the biscuits look in the pudding, as they are crushed very fine into crumbs.\n\nOrigin and history\nSerradura is a dessert originated in Portugal, which became famous in Macau. It is a very common dessert that can be easily found in different restaurants and bakeries in Macau, which is why Serradura is chosen as one of the must-try foods of Macau.Serradura was introduced to Macau during a time when Macau was under the colonial rule of Portugal. It can also be found in Hong Kong, in Goa, India (former Portuguese colony), and various Portuguese and Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nVarieties\nFlavours\nTraditionally, Serradura was in the flavour of tea biscuits, also known as Marie biscuits, and whipped cream. Later on, it has been developed into many different flavours, including Oreo, coffee beans, nuts, green tea, and so on, by varying on the cream or the biscuits crumbs. For the sawdust, some recipes use biscuits or powder to mix with Marie biscuits or even replace it. As for the variation on the cream, some recipes may add different flavourings to the cream to create other taste such as chocolate, strawberry, green tea etc.\n\nForm\nIn terms of the form that Serradura is served, it usually comes in two types, cake or pudding. The cake type Serradura is frozen into a harder state so that the texture of it is a bit like ice-cream. For the pudding style, it is also frozen but with a higher temperature, so that the cream solidify to a lower level to create a creamy texture.\n\nRecipe\nSerradura is quite easy to make, and only a few ingredients are needed. Condensed milk, Marie biscuit crumbs and whipping cream are the most common ingredients of Serradura, but sometimes thick cream would be used to replace whipping cream. Spread the whisked cream and the biscuits crumbs into a container alternately, after condensation in fridge for five to six hours, the dessert can be served.\nAs Serradura is more common and popular nowadays, people started to create new flavors, like green tea, chocolate, and Oreo flavors. To add different flavors into Serradura, green tea powder, vanilla extract or any other flavors can be added into the cream. Then, whisk them together. Another way to make some changes according to individual preferences, is to replace the Marie biscuits with other biscuits, such as Oreo.\n\nFamous Shops\nIn Macau\nSerrdura\nSerrdura is a Macau chain store selling cakes, sorbets, and serradura. The first retail store opened in May 2003. Currently, there are 3 branches in Macau. The store name Serrdura originated from the name of the Portuguese dessert, Serradura. Serradura is the signature dish of the store. The flavours of Serradura provided in the store include original, cookie, mango, durian, coffee, mango green tea, rocky road, and chocolate flavours.\n\nGelatina Mok Yi Kei\nGelatina Mok Yi Kei is a dessert store that has operated for over 80 years. It was a roadside food stand selling toast at first. Now, it is located on the Cunha street in Vila da Taipa. The store is well known for durian ice cream and serradura.

They can be prepared with many different fillings and are a common Christmas dish. Often they are served with vanilla custard.\n\nBackground\nApples are the most widely grown fruit in Germany, used to prepare many dishes and beverages in German cuisine. Apples were the only locally grown fruit in Germany that kept during the winter months, which made baked apples an economical choice for holiday desserts in the Christmas traditions of Germany or as a sweet main dish in cold weather.\n\nPreparation\nThe whole apples once cored can be stuffed with assorted fillings made from chopped almonds, marzipan, raisins, rum, butter, lemon juice, sugar, spices and other ingredients. Some versions are baked in a baking dish with white wine and honey and baked until tender. They are usually served with vanilla custard or ice cream.Apples can be baked on top of a wood stove or in the oven in round enamel cast iron dishes called \"apple schnitzers\". The dish has a spike in the center that cooks the cored apple from the inside out. Schnitzers may be a German invention, no longer widely used in Germany, but still found among Amish communities in the United States.\n\nSee also\nLebkuchen\nList of apple dishes\nSpringerle\nStollen\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Cr\u00eapes Suzette (pronounced [k\u0281\u025bp syz\u025bt]) is a French dessert consisting of cr\u00eapes with beurre Suzette (pronounced [b\u0153\u0281 syz\u025bt]), a sauce of caramelized sugar and butter, tangerine or orange juice, zest, and Grand Marnier, triple sec or orange Cura\u00e7ao liqueur on top, flamb\u00e9ed tableside.\n\nOrigins\nThe origin of the dish and its name is disputed. One claim is that it was created from a mistake made by a 14-year-old assistant waiter, Henri Charpentier, in 1895 at the Maitre at Monte Carlo's Caf\u00e9 de Paris. He was preparing a dessert for the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom (then Prince of Wales), whose guests included a beautiful French girl named Suzette. This story was told by Charpentier himself in Life \u00e0 la Henri, his autobiography, although later contradicted by the Larousse Gastronomique.\n\nIt was quite by accident as I worked in front of a chafing dish that the cordials caught fire. I thought it was ruined. The Prince and his friends were waiting. How could I begin all over? I tasted it. It was, I thought, the most delicious medley of sweet flavors I had ever tasted. I still think so. That accident of the flame was precisely what was needed to bring all those various instruments into one harmony of taste ... He ate the pancakes with a fork; but he used a spoon to capture the remaining syrup. He asked me the name of that which he had eaten with so much relish. I told him it was to be called Cr\u00eapes Princesse. He recognized that the pancake controlled the gender and that this was a compliment designed for him; but he protested with mock ferocity that there was a lady present. She was alert and rose to her feet and holding her little skirt wide with her hands she made him a curtsey. \"Will you,\" said His Majesty, \"change Cr\u00eapes Princesse to Cr\u00eapes Suzette?\" Thus was born and baptized this confection, one taste of which, I really believe, would reform a cannibal into a civilized gentleman. The next day I received a present from the Prince, a jeweled ring, a panama hat and a cane.\nDifferent sources (like the Larousse Gastronomique) however doubt that Charpentier, rather than the head waiter, was serving the prince, because he would have been too young.  A less fantastical version emerges from Elsie Lee's interview with him in the 1950s. There, Charpentier explained at length that \"his complicated version began as the dish of pancakes with fruit sauce his foster mother made on very special occasions.\" The addition of liqueur was common among chefs in Paris at the time.The other claim states that the dish was named in honour of French actress Suzanne Reichenberg (1853\u20131924), who worked professionally under the name Suzette. In 1897, Reichenberg appeared at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the role of a maid, during which she served cr\u00eapes on stage. Monsieur Joseph, owner of Restaurant Marivaux, provided the cr\u00eapes. He decided to flamb\u00e9 the thin pancakes to attract the audience's attention and keep the food warm for the actors consuming them. Joseph was subsequently director of the Paillard Restaurant in Paris and was later with the Savoy Hotel in London.\nIn 1896, Oscar Tschirky published the recipe as \"Pancakes, Casino Style\" with everything in place except the final flamb\u00e9e. Escoffier described Cr\u00eapes Suzette in the English version of his Guide Culinaire in 1907 (French 1903) the same way, also without the final flamb\u00e9e.\nThe dish was already a specialty of the French restaurant Marie's by 1898.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

Distinct in color and taste from meatloaf, hamloaf is often baked with a sweet glaze, often consisting of brown sugar, molasses, pineapples, or cherries. In Pennsylvania, hamloaf is sometimes served with a sauce consisting of vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar.  Eggs, milk, often evaporated, and some type of filling ingredient, bread or cracker crumbs, are used to create the loaf form.Attributed as a traditional Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, hamloaf is eaten throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and many other midwest states and is often served on special occasions, including Easter.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Queso flameado (Spanish for \"flamed cheese\";  also queso fundido, \"melted cheese\" or choriqueso) is a dish of hot melted cheese and spicy chorizo that is often served flamb\u00e9. Often compared to cheese fondue, it is a party dish;  it is popular at cookouts and in restaurants as an appetizer. Almost unique in Mexican cuisine, in the cuisine of the United States this dish has been widely adapted and is considered a native dish in El Paso. In Mexico, it occurs in restaurants more often in the north.\nTypical main ingredients are melted cheese and a characteristic meat sauce of loose fresh chorizo, tomato, onion, chile and spices.  It is served in a small, shallow casserole or other ceramic or metal heat-proof baking dish.  The cheese and sauce are prepared separately, and combined just before serving.  This may be done at the table, especially if finished with a flamb\u00e9:  high alcohol liquor is poured on the cheese and ignited, and as it burns the server folds in the sauce.  If not flamb\u00e9ed, the mixture may be quickly broiled.  Either way, the finished dish is presented while it is still bubbling hot, and it is spooned onto small soft tortillas for individual servings.\nQueso flameado is said to originate in the borderlands of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, as a campfire dish.In Tex-Mex restaurants, this dish is sometimes confused or conflated with chili con queso, a  cheese sauce served with tortilla chips for dipping.  The term queso fundido also refers to processed cheese and is defined as such in the Spanish version of Codex Alimentarius.\n\nVariations\nBoth the cheese and the meat sauce are prepared just before serving, and are served hot.  Oaxaca cheese and Chihuahua cheese are popular, but other melting cheeses (cheeses such as whole milk mozzarella, that remain stringy when melted) may be used.  Some consider stringy cheese to be an essential part of this dish, but if this quality is not desired then a fresh farmer's cheese or goat cheese is a good alternative.  If fresh chorizo is not available, pieces of dry chorizo or another sausage may be used.  Common additions are strips of roasted chiles and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms.  For the flamb\u00e9, popular liquors include rum, brandy, and tequila.  Of the two most common types of tortilla in Mexico and Texas, corn or wheat, may be used. In Puerto Vallarta, flour tortillas usually are served only with certain dishes including queso flameado, corn tortillas otherwise being the norm.\n\nSee also\nChili con queso\nList of cheese dishes\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of Mexican dishes\n Mexico portal\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Semolina pudding or semolina porridge is a porridge-type pudding made from semolina, which is cooked with milk, or a mixture of milk and water, or just water. It is often served with sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, raisins, fruit, or syrup. It is similar to grain based halva or halawa. A similar consistency to rice pudding can also be made by using more semolina and by baking, rather than boiling.\nSemolina pudding has been eaten in Europe since Roman times. The recipe book of Apicius (roughly dated 4th century AD) describes a semolina porridge made from farina mixed with almonds, raisins and raisin wine.Semolina pudding is also for sale as an instant (powdered) or prepared convenience food. Cream, vanilla, fruit, spices or artificial flavouring is often added. Some of these products must be prepared with milk or water. If only water is necessary, then powdered milk is often an ingredient of the convenience food.\n\nCzech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Croatia\nThe Czechs call it krupi\u010dn\u00e1 ka\u0161e or krupicov\u00e1 ka\u0161e, the Slovaks krupicov\u00e1 ka\u0161a, the Austrians Grie\u00dfkoch, the Germans Grie\u00dfbrei, the Slovenians ka\u0161a iz p\u0161eni\u010dnega zdroba, and the Croatians call it griz. It is served warm, sprinkled with cocoa and sugar, and doused with melted butter. Sometimes other variations and flavours may be used, such as cinnamon, honey, cherry compote, grated chocolate, tuzem\u00e1k, etc.\n\nRomania\nIn Romania it is called gri\u0219 cu lapte. Jam, candied fruit, cinnamon and raisins may be added. Once cooked, the preparation is poured into a cake pan. It is served warm or cold. The word gri\u0219 may come from German Grie\u00df similar to the English grit.\n\nHungary\nHungarians call this dish tejbegr\u00edz or tejbedara, meaning \"semolina in milk\". Usually cooked with a generous amount of sugar, some butter, and a pinch of salt. It is served warm either plain or sprinkled with cocoa powder, cinnamon sugar, sometimes with fresh or canned fruits, jam, vanilla, choco bits; modern additions include ice cream, whipped cream, brown sugar, maple syrup, candied fruit, granola, pumpkin seeds etc. A similar but much thicker pudding-like product, precooked and packaged as a store-bought convenience food, is marketed under the name gr\u00edzpuding (mirror translation for semolina pudding).\n\nLithuania\nIn Lithuania, this dish is called man\u0173 ko\u0161\u0117. Usually, it is cooked in a mixture of water, milk and sugar, and is always served warm, with a topping of cinnamon and sugar, or sometimes jam.\n\nSyria\nThis dish is well known in Damascus and Aleppo (as well as other parts of Syria) as Mamonia. It is prepared by adding butter-toasted semolina into boiling water that is mixed with sugar and sometimes cinnamon pieces. It is then served with a variety of toppings including but not limited to white cheese, cinnamon powder and pistachios.\n\nSee also\nCream of Wheat\nHalva\nList of porridges\nSago pudding\nRice pudding\nTapioca pudding\nMilk kissel\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Kopytka (literally \"little hooves\") are a kind of potato dumpling in Polish, Belarusian, and Lithuanian cuisines. They are similar to Italian gnocchi.\n\nPreparation and serving\nThe typical ingredients are boiled potatoes and flour, but may also include eggs, salt, and  other seasoning. The Polish dish is usually cooked in salted water, whereas in Belarusian and Lithuanian cuisines kapytki is baked first, then stewed or boiled in water.\nKopytka can be either a main dish or served on the side. Kopytka can be served savoury (baked with cheese, fried bacon, fried onion, or with a variety of sauces such as goulash or mushroom sauce); they can also be served sweet (with melted butter and sugar, cinnamon, or sweetened quark), or sugar with sour cream.\n\nEtymology\nThe word kopytka [kopyto \"hoof\", kopytko \"little hoof\", neuter singular nouns] is Polish for \"little hooves,\" such as those of a small hoofed animal (for example, a goat). Kapytki is the Belarusian word for the same concept. Both refer to the structure of these dumplings, which are formed in the shape of hooves.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is made by simmering milk on low heat for eight hours or longer.\n\nHistory\nBaked milk was relatively popular outside of Russia as well. It was deemed more palatable than boiled milk, and was described in medical literature as potentially more digestible. The most simple recipe suggested by 19th-century cookbooks for baked milk instructed one to leave milk in an oven overnight; however more elaborate recipes could be found as well.In rural areas, baked milk has been produced by leaving a jug of boiled milk in an oven for a day or overnight until it is coated with a brown crust. Prolonged exposure to heat causes reactions between the milk's amino acids and sugars, resulting in the formation of melanoidin compounds that give it a creamy color and caramel flavor. A great deal of moisture evaporates, resulting in a change of consistency. The stove in a traditional Russian loghouse (izba) sustains \"varying cooking temperatures based on the placement of the food inside the oven\".Today, baked milk is produced on an industrial scale. Like scalded milk, it is free of bacteria and enzymes and can be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours. Home-made baked milk is used for preparing a range of cakes, pies, and cookies.\nLong term consumption of baked milk may help for resolution of milk allergy. However, in some cases, acquired tolerance reverts back to unresolved allergy.\n\nFermented baked milk\nRyazhenka and varenets are fermented baked milk products, a type of traditional yoghurt. It is a common breakfast drink in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.\nIn peasant communities, varenets has been made in the traditional East Slavic oven by \"baking sour milk to a golden brown color\". In the Soviet era, the name \"ryazhenka\" came to be applied to a government-produced creme-colored drink without the skin.\n\nSee also\nCaramelized sweetened condensed milk, or dulce de leche, is a similar preparation used in home-made pastries, often prepared by prolonged heating of unopened cans of condensed milk.\nList of baked goods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Baked milk at Wikimedia Commons",

Ingredients include shrimp, mushrooms, bell peppers, sherry, a roux with butter, Parmesan cheese and other lighter cheese, and bread crumbs. The oysters are baked in the shell or can be made in a small casserole dish or au gratin dish. The dish was named for Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville (1680\u20131767), French governor of Louisiana and founder of New Orleans.\n\nSee also\nList of seafood dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A pickert (German: [\u02c8p\u026ak\u0250t] ) is a flat, fried or baked potato dish from Westphalia, Germany. It can be considered a kind of flattened dumpling or very nourishing pancake. It comes as a round Pfannenpickert the size of a pan, a rectangular Kastenpickert, or a palm-sized regular Pickert. The name is derived from Low German picken, pecken (\"to stick something onto something else\").\nThe main ingredients are grated potatoes, flour, milk, eggs, and (usually) raisins, with a little yeast, salt and sugar, and oil for the baking. Three big potatoes produce 10\u201315 palm-sized pickerts, enough for 4\u20135 people.\nPickerts are a specialty of the district of Lippe, where they developed from a traditional meal for the poorer people. In former times, Pickert was eaten as breakfast or lunch by poor farmers, being a cheap and very nourishing dish, as would be required of food for a day's work in the fields. They are now served spread with sugar beet syrup, butter or (plum) jam, or leberwurst.A related dish, Lappenpickert, is found in the regions west of Lippe, towards M\u00fcnster and the Ruhr Area. It does not usually contain raisins and yeast, but may have a dash of sweet cream added. Lappenpickert is usually baked in rather thin pancakes on a griddle greased with a side of lard, and eaten with the same spreads as Pickerts from Lippe, or with smoked fish or cold cuts.\n\nSee also\nR\u00f6sti\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nRecipe on FoodFamily.net\nRecipe and more information on lipperland.de - German\nRecipe on the website of the City of Detmold - German\nRecipe from Detmold-Brokhausen - German\nRecipe on lippisches.de - German\nRecipes and Stories around the Pickert on lippischer-pickert.de - German",

        "body": "Pom is a Surinamese oven dish made using arrowleaf elephant ear root, locally called \"pomtajer\".\n\nHistory\nWithin the Surinamese community, in both Suriname and the Netherlands, pom is the most popular and best-known festive dish.\nWithin the Surinamese community pom is frequently referred to as a dish of Creole or Jewish origin. It was introduced by the Portuguese\u2013Jewish plantation owners as the Portuguese potato (\"pomme de terre\") oven dish. Because the potato did not grow in Suriname and had to be imported, it was soon replaced with the root of the tayer plant. Pom combines three central ingredients: chicken, citrus juice and pomtajer (Xanthosoma sagittifolium). Only the latter is indigenous, and although all plant parts are edible, only the underground part of the main stem is used as an ingredient in preparing pom. The main stem or corm is most frequently designated as pomtajer or pongtaya (lit. the tajer/taya for pom).\nThe first published description of pom comes from the Encyclopedie van Nederlandsch West-Indi\u00eb (1914\u20131917) which describes the dish as follows: \u2018the big tajer, of which the stalk grows above the earth, is grated and treated with the juice of bitter oranges, afterwards with chicken or fish, made into a pie, which dish is known as pom.\u2019\nThe basic preparation method is saut\u00e9ed chicken pieces between two layers of raw, grated pomtajer, mixed with citrus juice and a sauce made from oil or margarine, onions, tomatoes, salt, pepper and nutmeg, baked in an oven until the pom becomes golden brown.\nIn Amsterdam alone there are over 120 establishments serving Surinamese food. Other Dutch cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague have a growing number of caterers, eateries and take-aways. Most establishments serve pom, and often also \u201cbroodje pom\u201d (pom on a bread roll), a derivation of the national dish. In particular, \u201cbroodje pom\u201d is rapidly gaining popularity and starting to appear on the Dutch menu. It can sometimes even be ordered in Dutch take-aways and for home delivery. In recent years, more and more recipes for pom have appeared in Dutch cookbooks, newspapers and on websites. In 2007, an exhibition about pom was held at Imagine Identity and Culture, an Amsterdam-based centre for the representation of migration and cultures as seen from their own perspective.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nVaneker, Karin. 2009.

        "body": "Pommes boulang\u00e8re or pommes \u00e0 la boulang\u00e8re \u2013 \"baker's potatoes\" \u2013 is a savoury dish of sliced potato and onion, cooked slowly in liquid in an oven.\n\nBackground\nThe name of the dish is said to derive from an old practice in French villages, where householders without their own ovens would take the prepared dish to the village bakery. After the baker had finished making his bread, the potato dish would cook slowly while the oven gradually died down.\n\nIngredients and variations\nThe basic ingredients are potatoes, onions and cooking liquid. The dish, cooked slowly in a low oven, gradually absorbing the cooking liquid, has a crisp top layer of sliced potatoes, with a softer mixture of onion and potato beneath. It is usual to season it with some or all of garlic, herbs (particularly rosemary or sage), salt and pepper, and to top the dish with dabs of butter before cooking, but there are several published variations:\n\nDespite the French name, the dish is not unique to France. The Yorkshire-born chef Brian Turner recalled in his memoirs (2000) being given an identical potato dish in his childhood, and Bobby Freeman in a 1997 book about Welsh cuisine gives a recipe for traditional Teisen nionod (onion cake), which she describes as \"the same dish as the French pommes boulang\u00e8re\".When diced bacon is added to the potatoes and onions, and the dish is topped with grated cheese before baking, it is known as pommes savoyarde (or alternatively as pommes Chamb\u00e9ry).\n\nNotes, references and sources\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nBeard, James (1974).

        "body": "Shortbread or shortie is a traditional Scottish biscuit usually made from one part white sugar, two parts butter, and three to four parts plain wheat flour. Shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking powder or baking soda. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland, and some Scottish brands are exported around the world.\n\nHistory\nShortbread originated in Scotland. Although it was prepared during much of the 12th century, and probably benefited from cultural exchange with French pastry chefs during the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland, the refinement of shortbread is popularly credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. Despite the enduring popular association, evidence for any connection between Mary and shortbread's origin is sparse.Triangular wedges of shortbread became known as \"petticoat tails\", and this form of shortbread has become particularly associated with Mary, Queen of Scots. It has been suggested that a French term for the wedges of shortbread was petits g\u00e2teaux or petites gatelles \u2013 little cakes, and this became \"petticoat tails\". It is now thought the Scots term derives from the decorated round edge of the segments which resemble petticoats.The first printed recipe, in 1736, was from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock.Shortbread was expensive and reserved as a luxury for special occasions such as Christmas, Hogmanay (Scottish New Year's Eve), and weddings.  In Scotland, it was traditional to break a decorated shortbread cake (infar-cake or dreaming bread) over the head of a new bride on the entrance of her new house.  Shortbread was also given as a gift.\n\nName\nShortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word \"short\", as opposed to \"long\", or stretchy). The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter. The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein (gluten) strands.  The related word \"shortening\" refers to any fat that may be added to produce a \"short\" (crumbly) texture.In British English, shortbread and shortcake were synonyms for several centuries, starting in the 1400s; both referred to the crisp, crumbly cookie-type baked good, rather than a softer cake.  The \"short-cake\" mentioned in Shakespeare's play The Merry Wives of Windsor, first published in 1602, was a reference to the cookie-style of shortbread.In American English, shortbread is different from shortcake.  Shortcake usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder, which gives it a different, softer texture, and it was normally split and filled with fruit.  The most popular example of this difference is strawberry shortcake.\n\nIngredients\nOther ingredients are often substituted for part of the flour to alter the texture.  Rice flour or semolina makes it grittier, and cornflour makes it more tender.Bere or oat flour may be added for flavour.Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt. \nSpices and ingredients such as almonds may be added.\n\nShapes\nShortbread is commonly formed into one of three shapes: \n\none large circle, which is divided into segments as soon as it is taken out of the oven (petticoat tails, which may have been named from the French petits cot\u00e9s, a pointed biscuit eaten with wine, or petites gastelles, the old French term for little cakes.  This term may also reference the shape of a petticoat);\nindividual round biscuits (shortbread rounds); or\na thick (\u00be\" or 2 cm) oblong slab cut into fingers.Shortbread may also be made in farls.\nIn one of the oldest shapes, bakers pinched the edges of a shortbread round to suggest the rays of the sun.The stiff dough retains its shape well during cooking.  The biscuits are often patterned before cooking, usually with the tines of a fork or with a springerle-type mold.  Shortbread is sometimes shaped into hearts and other shapes for special occasions.\n\nVarieties\nVariations in ingredients for some recipes include the optional addition of caraway seeds to petticoat tails, coriander and caraway in Goosnargh, egg yolk and cream in Ayrshire, citrus peel and almonds in Pitcaithly bannock, and demerara sugar in Dorset.Millionaire's shortbread, also called caramel squares, is a modern variation, in which shortbread is topped with caramel and chocolate.\n\nCultural associations\nIn ancient Scottish folklore, sun-shaped cakes, such as shortbread, had magic powers over the Sun during the Scottish New Year's Eve.Shortbread is generally associated with and originated in Scotland, but due to its popularity it is also made in the rest of the United Kingdom, and similar biscuits are also made in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden.  The Scottish version is the best-known, and is widely exported.\nScottish chef John Quigley, of Glasgow's Red Onion, describes shortbread as \"the jewel in the crown\" of Scottish baking.An early variety of shortbread, using ginger, was reportedly eaten during sittings of the Parliament of Scotland, and therefore the variety was sometimes called \"Parliament cake\" or \"Parlies\" into the 19th century. The biscuits were sold in Mrs Flockhart's tavern and shop in Bristo Street in Edinburgh's Potterrow. Known as Luckie Fykie, the landlady was thought to be the inspiration for Mrs Flockhart in Walter Scott's Waverley.In the UK tax code, shortbread is taxed as a flour confection (baked good) rather than as a common biscuit.\n\nSee also\nButter cookie\nNankhatai\nShortcake, a soft cake with a similar name\nSugar cookie\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Shake 'n Bake is a seasoned bread crumb coating originally marketed to mimic the flavor and texture of Southern fried chicken. Introduced in 1965 by General Foods, it is currently made under the Kraft Heinz brand.\n\nConcept\nShake 'n Bake provides a baked alternative to foods fried in oil. The product is applied by placing raw meat or vegetable pieces in a bag containing the coating, closing the bag, and shaking it so the coating adheres to the pieces. They are then placed on a baking sheet and cooked in an oven. Shake 'n Bake has been marketed as a healthier and less-greasy alternative to frying, with slogans such as, \"Shake 'n Bake: It's better than frying\", and \"Why fry? Shake 'n Bake\".\n\nIngredients\nShake 'n Bake Original Pork flavor contains the following ingredients: enriched wheat flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamin mononitrate Vitamin B1, riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid), salt, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, sugar, contains less than 2% of paprika, dextrose, dried onions, spice, caramel color, yeast, annatto (color), and natural flavor. Barbecue flavor Shake 'n Bake includes sugar, maltodextrin, salt, modified food starch, spice, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, brown sugar, mustard seed flour, dried onions, dried tomatoes, dried garlic, beet powder (color), citric acid, natural flavor, caramel color, vinegar, and sodium silicoaluminate as an anticaking agent.\n\nAdvertisements\nShake 'n Bake is particularly noted for its television commercials in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, starring such child actors as Carrie Jean Cochran, Carly Schroeder, Taylor Momsen, and Philip Amelio. In the ads, the aforementioned children help make Shake 'n Bake with their mothers, enthusiastically exclaiming, \"And I helped!\"\nIn the 70s, Shake 'N Bake had a line of advertisements featuring a butcher named Pete The Butcher who constantly promotes Shake 'N Bake to his customers. Pete the Butcher was played by John Braden. In 1981 one of his ads included Ann B. Davis, who played Alice the housekeeper on The Brady Bunch. The ad copy includes the catchphrases, \"Gotta be crispy, gotta be golden, gotta be juicy\", and, \"You just shake then bake, and that chicken's so crisp and juicy and golden it makes me look golden, if you know what I mean\".In 1990, two commercials were produced which show what pork chops and chicken look like after frying. They then show that pork chops and chicken are crispier, juicier, more plump, and more tender when used with Shake n' Bake than when fried. They conclude with, \"Why fry? Shake n' Bake\".\nIn 1998, a new commercial was tried with a different catchphrase: \"Mama made Shake 'n Bake, and I helped\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "body": "Hiestand Holding AG, based in Schlieren, was a listed Swiss large-scale bakery with a focus on convenience frozen baked goods (\"ready to bake products\") as well as sales concepts and services, which merged into the Aryzta Group in 2008. The Hiestand Group as a whole employed around 3,200 people and generated sales of 741 million Swiss francs in 2007. Aryzta in Switzerland continues to use the Hiestand brand for baked goods.\n\nHistory\nAt the age of 24, Alfred \u201cFredy\u201d Hiestand set up his first bakery with second-hand dough machines in an unused laundromat. His starting capital was CHF 5,000.\nIn 1967, together with Albert Abderhalden, he laid the foundation for a convenience frozen baked goods group that, before its takeover in 2008, generated sales of 740.7 million Swiss francs with around 3,200 employees.A year later, Hiestand developed the first croissant dough pieces as a semi-finished product for bakeries, which he sold to major customers. In 1988, the decisive factor was the pre-fermentation of the dough before freezing, so that it could be baked quickly and easily later on at the point of sale. After this successful development, he became known in Switzerland as the \"Gipfeli-King\".In 2003 Alfred Hiestand sold his share and withdrew from the company. For a time, Albert Abderhalden ran the company.Hiestand has also been represented in Germany since 1989 with the Hiestand and Suhr brands. In 2006, Hiestand took over the Fricopan company in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln with its branch in Immekath, Saxony-Anhalt. Hiestand had subsidiaries in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Poland, Malaysia, Japan and Turkey.In August 2008, the company merged with its largest shareholder, the Irish IAWS Group, to form Aryzta. The two companies continued to operate independently on the market under the same roof with their existing brands. Hiestand Holding shares were listed on the SWX Swiss Exchange until 20 August 2008.\n\nLiterature\nPhilipp Gut: Gipfelik\u00f6nig Fredy Hiestand.

        "body": "Kansas City\u2013style barbecue is a slowly smoked meat barbecue originating in Kansas City, Missouri in the early 20th century. It has a thick, sweet sauce derived from brown sugar, molasses, and tomatoes. Henry Perry is credited as its originator, as two of the oldest Kansas City\u2013style barbecue restaurants still in operation trace their roots back to Perry's pit.\n\nOverview\nKansas City barbecue uses a wide variety of meats, such as pork, beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, sausage, and sometimes fish. It is seasoned with a dry rub, slow-smoked over a variety of woods and served with a thick tomato-based barbecue sauce.Most local restaurants and sauce companies offer several varieties with spicy and tangy flavor profiles. Historically, the sauces were not sweet until Rich Davis, a child psychiatrist from KC developed the KC Masterpiece sauce with molasses, which varies greatly from the more traditional sauces at the longtime KC BBQ restaurants where orders are made at a counter.Burnt ends are the crusty, fatty, flavorful meat cut from the point of a smoked beef brisket. Side dishes include a unique style of baked beans, French fries, and coleslaw.\n\nHistory\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area has more than 100 barbecue restaurants, several of which are nationally renowned. The area has several large barbecue cooking contests, such as the Great Lenexa BBQ Battle and the American Royal World Series of Barbecue, the largest barbecue competition in the world.\n\nHenry Perry\nKansas City barbecue history originated with Henry Perry, who operated out of a trolley barn at 19th and Highland in the legendary African-American neighborhood around 18th and Vine.\nPerry served slow-cooked ribs on pages of newsprint for 25 cents a slab. He came from Shelby County, Tennessee, near Memphis, and began serving barbecue in 1908. Kansas City and Memphis barbecue styles are somewhat similar, although Kansas City tends to use more sauce and a wider variety of meats. His sauce had a somewhat harsh, peppery flavor.\nPerry's restaurant became a major cultural point during the heyday of Kansas City Jazz during the \"wide-open\" days of Tom Pendergast in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nArthur Bryant\nWorking for Henry Perry was Charlie Bryant, who in turn brought his brother, Arthur Bryant, into the business. Charlie took over the Perry restaurant in 1940 after Perry died. Arthur then took over his brother's business in 1946, and the restaurant was renamed Arthur Bryant's.\nArthur Bryant's, which eventually moved to 1727 Brooklyn in the same neighborhood, became a hangout for baseball fans and players in the 1950s and 1960s, because of its close proximity to Municipal Stadium, where the Kansas City Athletics or A's played their home games during that period.\nIn April 1972, Kansas City native Calvin Trillin wrote an article in Playboy proclaiming Bryant's the best restaurant on the planet.\nWith new-found fame, Bryant did not change the restaurant's very simple decor, which consisted of fluorescent lighting, Formica tables, and five-gallon jars of sauce displayed in the windows, even when visited by Presidents Harry Truman, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan.\nBryant died of a heart attack, in a bed that he kept at the restaurant, shortly after Christmas 1982.\nAlong the main inner wall of the restaurant is photographic history of many famous politicians, actors, actresses and sports figures and other tribute pictures of military personnel displaying Arthur Bryant's memorabilia such as shirts or bottles of sauce.\n\nGates and Sons\nIn 1946 Arthur Pinkard, who was a cook for Perry, joined with George Gates to form Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q. The restaurant was situated initially in the same neighborhood.\nGates barbecue sauce does not contain molasses; the ingredients, as listed on the bottle, are: \"Tomatoes, vinegar, salt, sugar, celery, garlic, spices, and pepper. 1/10 of 1% potassium sorbate preservative added.\" It is available in Original Classic, Mild, Sweet & Mild, and Extra Hot varieties.\nGates also expanded its footprint in a more conventional way, with restaurants all displaying certain common features\u2014red-roofed buildings, a recognizable logo (a strutting man clad in tuxedo and top hat) and the customary \"Hi, may I help you?\" greeting belted out by its employees as patrons enter.\n\nOther restaurants\nFiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue\nFiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue had its beginnings as the second restaurant in the Smokestack BBQ chain, which Russ Fiorella Sr. had started in 1957. Fiorella's eldest son Jack worked with his father until 1974, when he and his wife Delores opened their own Smokestack location in the Martin City neighborhood of south Kansas City.Eventually Jack, along with his wife and children, decided to expand their menu selections, adding non-traditional barbecue menu items like hickory-grilled steaks, lamb ribs, crown prime beef ribs, and fresh, hickory-grilled seafood, along with an extensive wine and bar selection.\nThey also began offering a higher level of comfort and service than most people were accustomed to at a barbecue restaurant. Smokestack BBQ in Martin City soon became one of the most successful restaurants in the Kansas City metro. In 1996, Jack Fiorella was named Restaurateur of the Year by the Greater Kansas City Restaurant Association.By the mid-1990s, Jack Fiorella replicated the success of his Martin City Smokestack restaurant.\nOther members of the Fiorella family told Jack that he was not permitted to use the Smokestack name for his new restaurant, so both the new restaurant (opened in 1997 in Overland Park, Kansas) and Jack's existing restaurant in Martin City dropped the Smokestack name and were rebranded as Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue. They also opened a full-service catering operation in Martin City and their third location in the historic Freight House building in the Crossroads Arts District.\nThey began shipping their barbecue nationwide in 2000, and in October 2006 they opened a fourth location on The Country Club Plaza. In 2014, a fifth Jack Stack restaurant opened in Lee's Summit, Missouri.\nThe original Smokestack chain closed its last remaining location in 2012.\nFiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue has been featured on The Food Network and The History Channel, and has been rated as among the best barbecue in the United States by several national organizations and magazines. Most notably, the Zagat Survey has named it the \"#1 Barbecue House in the Country.\"\n\nJoe's Kansas City\nJoe\u2019s Kansas City Bar-B-Que can be traced to competition barbecue and the Kansas City Barbeque Society (KCBS). Accompanying friends at the American Royal and The Great Lenexa BBQ Battle inspired Jeff Stehney to start cooking on his own. The first smoker purchased was an Oklahoma Joe's 24\" smoker, christened in April 1991.\nBy 1993, Jeff, his wife and business partner Joy, and Jim \"Thurston\" Howell were ready to join the KCBS competition circuit. Their competition team, Slaughterhouse Five, won eight Grand Championships, including the prestigious American Royal BBQ, three Reserve Grand Championships, and the KCBS's Grand Champion \"Team of the Year\" in 1993. Over the next several seasons Slaughterhouse Five won dozens more awards and was generally recognized as one of the top competition BBQ teams in the Country.\nJeff and Joy opened Oklahoma Joe's Bar-B-Que (later renamed to Joe's Kansas City Bar-B-Que) in a gas station in Kansas City, Kansas in 1996. There are also locations in Olathe, Kansas and Leawood, Kansas.\nCelebrity chef Anthony Bourdain listed Joe's original Kansas City, Kansas location as one of \"13 Places You Must Eat Before You Die\". Men's Health magazine named it America's manliest restaurant. Joe's was featured on Season 3 of Man v. Food in August 2010. It was also named \"Kansas City's Best Barbecue\" by Zagat.\n\nKC Masterpiece\nIn 1977, Rich Davis capitalized on the reputation of Kansas City barbecue to form KC Masterpiece, which evolved from his \"K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce\". KC Masterpiece is sweeter and thicker than many of the traditional Kansas City sauces served in the region. The KC Masterpiece recipe uses extra molasses to achieve its thick, sweet character.KC Masterpiece was sold to Kingsford charcoal in 1986 and now claims to be the number-one premium barbecue brand in the U.S. When Davis sold the rights to his sauce to Kingsford, he announced plans to build a franchise of barbecue restaurants.  The franchises were successful for a few years, but have since all closed.\n\nCurt's Famous Meats\nCurt's Famous Meats was a meat market founded in 1947 by Curtis Jones and sold to Donna Pittman in 1989. With clientele from all across America, Curt's specializes in barbecue prepared with Kansas City rub. It has a long history of award-winning barbecue, having won eight times the American Royal barbecue competition, the largest in the world. It closed and was for sale as of July, 2018 after seventy years of operation.\nLocated on East Truman Road in the Kansas City suburb of Independence, Missouri, Curt's has been a large competitor in many local barbecue competitions. Curt's was also known for its predominantly female staff, nicknamed the Lady Meat Cutters.\n\nJones Bar-B-Q\nJones Bar-B-Q is an independent barbecue joint on Kaw Drive in Kansas City, Kansas, owned by Deborah and Mary Jones.\nIn 2001 Doug Worgul featured Jones Bar-B-Q in the afterword of The Grand Barbecue: A Celebration of the History, Places, Personalities and Techniques of Kansas City Barbecue.:\u200a120\u200a Worgul said the sisters' barbecue \"represent[ed] an artisan approach that cannot be replicated in higher-volume barbecue restaurants\" and calls the location, a former taco stand, \"the jointiest joint I've ever seen.\" In 2016 Ardie Davis called it \"old school\", saying the barbecue is straightforward, not oversmoked, and not overtrimmed.As of 2016, the Kansas City Star considered them possibly the only Kansas City barbecue owned and operated by women pitmasters. The sisters do not participate in the barbecue competition circuit.In 2018, they appeared on an episode of Steve Harvey's Steve in a segment titled \"The Queens of Barbecue\".In March 2019, the sisters and the barbecue were featured on the third season of American television series Queer Eye, which was filmed in and near Kansas City. Both they and the restaurant received a makeover, and they started bottling their sauce. In the aftermath, they had to put in a second barbecue pit to handle demand.In 2019, Jones Bar-B-Q's Coconut Pineapple sauce was named by Bloomberg News as one of their five favorite barbecue sauces.\n\nSee also\nBacon Explosion\nBurnt ends\nDoug Worgul\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of smoked foods\nRegional variations of barbecue\nSt. Louis\u2013style barbecue\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKansas City barbecue restaurants\nKC Library History of Gates\nKansas City Library Barbecue history resources\nKansas City Barbeque Society\nAmerican Royal BBQ Contest Information and Contest Results",

        "body": "A bake sale, also known as a cake sale or cake stall, is a fundraising activity where baked goods such as doughnuts, cupcakes and cookies, sometimes along with other foods, are sold. Bake sales are usually held by small, non-profit organizations, such as clubs, school groups and charitable organizations. Bake sales are often set up around an area of pedestrian traffic, such as outside a grocery store or at a busy intersection near a mall.\nBake sales are also a popular means of fundraising within corporations and political organizations.\n\nHistory\nThe advent of bake sales dates back to the 1800s, during which time women used their domestic skills to fulfill expectations of charity. Since then, bake sales have been frequently used as a form of raising money for political or social causes. In the early 1900s, suffragettes in Virginia used bake sales as a means to raise money to further the cause of women's suffrage. During the civil rights movement in the United States, Georgia Gilmore began a covert baking club that, in order to fund resistance efforts, sold savory meals and baked goods out of members' homes as well as in local establishments and at protest meetings.In response to the murder of George Floyd in 2020, pastry chefs Willa Pelini, Paola Velez, and Rob Rubba organized a series of national bake sales that eventually became known as Bakers Against Racism. Originally intended as a singular event, the initiative attracted the participation of professional and hobbyist bakers across the country, each of whom contributed baked goods for various sales to raise money for organizations that support Black lives. Bakers Against Racism has since expanded efforts to help organizations working to end hate crimes against Asian Americans and people of Pacific Islander heritage.\n\nConduct\nBake sales are most often held to raise money for specific causes or for a particular organization, and frequently take place at schools or churches. Goods most commonly sold at bake sales include cookies, brownies, cupcakes, and muffins.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nA Heritage of Bake Sales\nBake Sale Tips from the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale\nBake Sale Flyers\nBake Sale Tips and Flyer Templates",

It is chewy, similar to mochi, and subtly sweet. Flavors include azuki bean paste, green tea (matcha), yuzu, strawberry and chestnut. Nagoya is particularly famous for its uir\u014d, and there are other regional versions, notably in Yamaguchi and Odawara, although Odawara's uir\u014d is better known as a medicine. It can be purchased in traditional Japanese confectionery shops throughout Japan.Uir\u014d was originally the name of a medicine in the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573).

        "body": "A blondie (also known as a blonde brownie) is a variety of dessert bar. It resembles a chocolate brownie, but substitutes vanilla in place of cocoa, and contains brown sugar. Blondies also contain flour, butter, eggs, and baking powder and may also contain walnuts or pecans, white or dark chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, toffee chips, or other flavored chips.Blondies differ significantly from white chocolate brownies. Unlike the white chocolate brownie or the normal brownie, they contain no chocolate or chocolate flavouring, other than chocolate chips, which may be included. They may also contain coconut, nuts, toffee, or any other chunky candy for added texture. Blondies are not usually frosted; the brown sugar tends to be sweet enough. A variation is the Congo bar, which contains chocolate chips with either walnuts or coconut.\nThey are baked in a pan in an oven in a manner similar to that of the baking of traditional brownies, then they are cut into rectangular shapes for serving. Blondies are sometimes served in sundaes, often topped with caramel sauce.\n\nHistory\nBlondies existed for at least ten years before chocolate brownies; \"dense, fudgy, butterscotch-flavoured bar[s]\" existed in the late 19th century, and chocolate brownies were not developed until 1905.Blondies were made popular in Hawaii by Kamehameha Schools where they are known as haole brownies. \"Haole\" is the dynamic translation for \"blonde\", a characteristic of a white person. But it may be a corruption of the word h\u0101uli, meaning \"dark\".\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Manapua is the Hawaiian adaptation for the Chinese food baozi. Its origins is in char siu bao. However, in contemporary times, the term is generally applied to a large char siu bao or other steamed, baked, or fried bao variations of different fillings.\n\nBackground\nThe prospect of financial reward found in the sugar industry caused the Chinese immigration starting in the mid 1800s. The Chinese would bring along with them their foods including baozi, a carbohydrate rich food essential for sustenance against the intense physical labor demanded in sugar production. Some of these Chinese laborers, who would later be known as a \"manapua man\", would peddle their char siu bao in the plantation fields and to other plantation camps by foot and later by vehicle for additional income.These char siu bao would later be known as manapua, said to be a contraction or creole-pidgin form of the Hawaiian words mea \u02bbono pua\u02bba, roughly translated as \"pork cake\" - mea\u02bbono lit. \"delicious thing\" (definition applied to dessert, cake, pastry, cookie) and pua\u02bba meaning \"pork\" (or \"pig\").These traditional char siu bao would eventually grow in size into the modern manapua known today. Bat Moi Kam Mau is credited with retailing the first large char siu bao in the 1940s at her manapua shop \"Char Hung Sut\".\nIn the 1970s, the \"Royal Kitchen\" introduced \"baked manapua\" with various fillings which remains hugely popular today.\n\nDescription\nWhile manapua dimensions are not formally regulated, once cooked, many are close to 4-5 inches (~13cm) in diameter and 3-4 inches (~8cm) in height. Ironically, char siu bao sold in many classic Chinese restaurants still retain their original size and shape and are simply known by its original name rather than as manapua.\nChar siu remains a staple filling. However, its preparation is sometimes simplified to pork with char siu flavoring rather than being prepared with actual roasted char siu. Other fillings have been introduced, some reflecting the various ethnic groups in Hawaii. Other common meat fillings include: lup chong and hot dog which uses a full (uncut) sausage, chicken curry, and kalua pork. Vegetarian options include: black bean paste commonly known as \"black sugar\", azuki similar to anpan, Okinawan purple sweet potato (sometimes mislabeled as ube).Novelty or uncommon fillings like chicken adobo, pizza, Portuguese sausage, SPAM, spicy pork bulgogi, pastele stew, matcha will pop up at festivals. If found to be popular, may become a permanent menu item.  One local shop boast over 30 flavors and are deep fried.\nA single bun can be consumed as a \"meal in itself\" or divided and shared as a snack along with other local style dim sum items. \nOlder standalone manapua shops will also offer a handful of other dim sum items such as fun guo  known as \"pepeiao\", gok jai or \"half moon\" which are normally steamed, shumai or \"pork hash\". Like the manapua, these too, have become twice the size of their original counterparts. Manapua and these other dim sum items are often bought in bulk as omiyage when traveling to the neighbor island or out-of-state, or shared in office meetings or breakrooms akin to donuts.\n\nIn popular culture\nManapua Man\nIn the 1970s, manapua hawkers would trade in their carrying pole for a converted full-size van. These modern hawkers, affectionately known as a \"manapua man,\" would drive their \"manapua van\" through neighborhoods very much like an ice cream truck playing music to attract customers or are found parked at certain locations like a food truck. They are a beloved sight for neighborhood children and passerby looking for a very affordable quick meal or snack. Some vans are more akin to a convenience store on wheels, sometimes not selling manapua at all. Items sold range from chow mein to candies, burgers to fountain drinks, and at one point, cigarettes and beer.\n\nUrban legend\n\"Cat manapua\" or manapua filled with cat meat is an idea sometimes brought up as a running joke seen in modern times as a microaggression towards the Chinese. Historically, some viewed the Chinese as stingy so much so that the Hawaiian translation of Chinese, P\u0101k\u0113 (wikt:P\u0101k\u0113), is still used as slang for an extremely frugal person regardless of ethnicity. The urban legend of \"cat manapua\" often implied that the Chinese were producing manapua made with feral cats to avoid paying extra for pork.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Hawaii\nChar siu bao\nBaozi\nDim sum\nSiopao\n\n\n== References ==",

Some associate it with the arrival of Portuguese and Italian bakers in the early twentieth century, while others believe that it came to existence in the kitchen of an Italian baker named Pietroluchi Pancaldi in Lusite\u00f1a, Caracas in 1940. While others believe Cachitos is a derivate of the Venezuelan Christmas dish, Pan de Jamon.\nCachitos are a staple in Venezuelan cuisine. Normally, they are eaten during breakfast hours, but they are also known to be eaten throughout the day. In Venezuela, some bakeries have made sure that the scent of fresh Cachitos are in the air by the time the country wakes up, but outside of the country it is hard to find such delicacies from the local bakery. They are usually accompanied by natural juices, coffee or malta.\n\nSee also\nVenezuelan cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A cheese zombie is the name of two different baked goods filled with melted cheese.\nOne type of cheese zombie was invented in Yakima, Washington by employees of the Grandview School District in the early 1960s.\nThe employees were under the direction of Dorothy L. Finch, the lunch program supervisor.\nFinch and her employees invented the cheese zombie while trying to come up with ways to use surplus Velveeta cheese.\nThe Yakima cheese zombie consists of a layer of cheese baked between two layers of bread dough and then sliced into squares, giving them the appearance of sandwiches.\nThe cheese zombie was so named because one of the cooks said the first batch looked like a zombie.A second type of cheese zombie was invented in Concord, California in 1963 by Decla Phillips and Helen Ballock, bakers employed at Mount Diablo High School.\nThe Concord cheese zombie was also created by layering cheese, in this case American cheese, between two layers of bread dough.\nA key difference between the Concord and Yakima cheese zombies is that the Concord version is cut into circles and crimped with a special tool before baking, which helps to contain the cheese within the bun.\nThe pair were possibly inspired by Ballock's husband's recipe for Pirozhki.In 2009, the term \"cheese zombie\" was registered as a trademark by Dumploads On Us, owned by Eric Giacobazzi.\nThe trademark was granted June 5, 2012.\nIn 2013, Patty's Original Cheese Zombies, Inc. was founded by Patty May, a former Mount Diablo Unified School District baker, and her son Robert May.\nThey were notified by Giacobazzi that he owned the trademark.\nOn April 2, 2014, Patty's Original Cheese Zombies, Inc. petitioned the United States Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the trademark, arguing that it was generic.\nThe USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board canceled the trademark, ruling that while it was not generic it was \"merely descriptive\".\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n== Referecnes ==",

        "body": "The Chopin Alveograph is a tool for flour quality measurement. It measures the flexibility of the dough produced from the flour, by inflating a bubble in a thin sheet of the dough until it bursts.  The resulting values show the strength of the flour, and thus its suitability for different uses.\nIt was developed in 1920 in France by Marcel Chopin, who named it the Extensimeter.\n\nHistory\nDeveloped in the late 1920s in France by Marcel Chopin, the Chopin Alveograph is used in bakery worldwide. The alveographic test enables to measure the tenacity (resilience), the extensibility, and elasticity of a dough (standardized mix of flour and water). This measurement of the strength of flours is considered as a good index of the baking quality of baking flours.\nIn France, it has been used in regulations since at least 1963 as a criterion in milling for the composition of flours destined to the \"french\" type bread-baking.Agronomist Norman Borlaug (Nobel Prize in 1970) used this invention to select varieties of wheat for tropical environments.\n\nDescription\nThe Chopin alveograph is composed of two inseparable elements: \n\na kneading-machine equipped of an extraction passage which enables the development of the dough and the extraction of it for the preparation of the dough pieces in order to realise the alveographic test.\nthe alveograph in itself which measures the three-dimensional extension of the piece of dough, which is deformed like a bubble. That extension mode reproduces the deformation of the dough under the influence of the pushing of gas.Still used nowadays, the Chopin alveograph is manufactured by Chopin Technologies, subsidiary of the KPM Analytics company. They produce a derivative device called the Mixolab which, among other uses, measures the degree of degradation due to pest and fungus, and the protection provided by insecticides and fungicides.\n\nUsage Protocol\nCalibration\n1. Press the button 60/92\n2. Place the calibrator and tighten the lock screw.\n3. Open the valve to the maximum\n4. Launch the air by pressing button 92/60\n5. Adjust the high pression on 92 with the arrow, then press ok\n6. Adjust the low pression on 60 with the valve\n\nExperience\n1. Press on the green graph\n2. Select the little note at top right to settle parameters\n3. Pour 250g of the sample\n4. Fill the burette with salt solution (2.5%) function of the flour humidity\n5. Start the chronometer by pressing the green button\n6. Open to the maximum the burette overhead the hole of the tank\n\n7. At the end of the two first periods, stop the arm at the bottom of the tank by pressing the red button and scrape off the flour\n8. At 8 min, press on the arrow\n9. Remove the first centimeter of the emerging dough\n10. When the dough arrives at the level of the notches, cut the dough and flatten it with the rolling mill.\n11. Re-oil the tray between every dough pieces\n12. Cut a circle with the die-cutter and place in the oven\n13. At the last dough, press the red button first and the arrow\n14. Clean the tank\n15. At 28 min, press a long time on the 1 to reset the chronometer\n16. Center the dough, place the two covers, tighten the lock screw and remove the two covers\n17.

        "body": "Korean barbecue (Korean: \uace0\uae30\uad6c\uc774, gogi-gui, 'meat roast') is a popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling meat, typically beef, pork or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining table itself. Some Korean restaurants that do not have built-in grills provide customers with portable stoves for diners to use at their tables. Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes that are made to order.\nThe most representative form of gogi-gui is bulgogi, usually made from thinly sliced marinated beef sirloin or tenderloin. Another popular form is galbi, made from marinated beef short ribs. However, gogi-gui also includes many other kinds of marinated and unmarinated meat dishes, and can be divided into several categories. Korean barbecue is popular in its home country. It gained its global popularity through Hallyu, more commonly known as the \"Korean Wave\",  a term that describes the rise in popularity of Korean culture during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nHistory\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty (1392\u20131910), roasted beef Neobiani was a favorite of the Joseon royal family.\n\nVarieties\nMarinated barbecue meats\nBulgogi (\ubd88\uace0\uae30) is the most popular variety of Korean barbecue. Before cooking, the meat is marinated with a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, ginger, scallions, sesame oil, garlic and pepper. Pears are also traditionally used in the marinade to help tenderize the meat, but kiwi and pineapple have also been used more recently. It is traditionally cooked using gridirons or perforated dome griddles that sit on braziers, but pan cooking has become common as well.Galbi (\uac08\ube44) is made with beef short ribs, marinated in a sauce that may contain mirin, soy sauce, water, garlic, brown sugar, sugar and sliced onions. It is believed to taste best when grilled with charcoal or soot (\uc22f, burned wood chips).Jumulleok (\uc8fc\ubb3c\ub7ed) is short steak marinated with sesame oil, salt and pepper. It is similar to unmarinated gogi-gui, distinguished it from other kinds of meat by its steak-like juicy texture. Jumulleok is also commonly found with sliced duck instead of beef.\nDwaeji bulgogi (\ub3fc\uc9c0\ubd88\uace0\uae30), or spicy pork, is also a popular gogigui dish. It is different from beef bulgogi in that the marinade is not soy sauce-based, but, instead, is marinated in sauces based on gochujang and/or gochu garu (Korean chili powder). The flavor is usually better when made with fattier cuts of pork, such as pork shoulder or pork belly.\n\nUn-marinated barbecue meats\nChadolbagi or chadolbaegi is a dish made from thinly sliced beef brisket, which is not marinated. It is so thin that it cooks nearly instantly as soon as it is dropped onto a heated pan.\nSamgyeopsal is made of thicker strips of unsalted pork belly. It has fatty areas and is tender. In Korea, samgyeopsal is eaten more frequently than chadolbaegi due to the comparatively lower price of pork.\n\nLoins (deungsim, \ub4f1\uc2ec) and boneless ribs (galbisal, \uac08\ube44\uc0b4) are also a popular choice as an unmarinated type of gogigui.\n\nSide dishes\nGogi-gui comes with various banchan (side dishes). The most popular side dishes are rice and kimchi, and a green onion salad called pajeori and a fresh vegetable dish including lettuce, cucumbers, and peppers invariably accompany the meat dishes at restaurants. Other popular side dishes include the spinach side dish (sigeumchi namul/\uc2dc\uae08\uce58\ub098\ubb3c), egg roll omelette (gyeran-mari/\uacc4\ub780\ub9d0\uc774), spicy radish salad (mu saengchae/\ubb34\uc0dd\ucc44), and a steamed egg souffl\u00e9 (gyeran-jjim/\uacc4\ub780\ucc1c). A popular way of eating Korean barbecue is to wrap the meat with lettuce and/or perilla leaves and add condiments such as pajeori (spicy scallion salad) and ssamjang (a spicy paste made of doenjang mixed with gochujang).Korean barbecue is also popularly paired with alcoholic drinks, such as beer, soju, makgeolli, or wine.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAsado\nBarbecue restaurant\nJeok\nKorean cuisine\nYakiniku\n\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\uad6c\uc774 (in Korean).

The Yiddish word mandlbroyt literally means almond bread, a reference to its common ingredient of almonds. It is typically formed by baking a loaf which is then cut into small slabs and twice-baked in order to form a crunchy exterior. The cookies were popular in Eastern Europe among rabbis, merchants and other itinerant Jews as a staple dessert that kept well.Its precise origin is unknown, as is its historic relationship with biscotti, a similar Italian cookie. It is made with oil and not butter and so is pareve and can be served as part of the Shabbat dinner.The basic ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs and oil. Additional ingredients vary between bakers, but common additions include almonds, walnuts, cinnamon, chocolate chips or diced candied fruit. Mandelbrot is called kamishbrot in Ukraine, and the two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States.\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\nList of cookies\n Food portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRecipe for Mandelbrot",

It is also a popular Czech and Slovak sweet.\nTraditionally, pryaniks are made from flour and honey. While some Russian-English dictionaries translate pryanik as gingerbread, ginger is an optional pryanik ingredient, unlike honey. Sugar is often used instead of honey in industrial pryaniki production and modern home-cooking.\nRelated to pryanik is kovrizhka (\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0438\u0436\u043a\u0430), sweet bread with similar ingredients.\nThe word pryanik is from Old East Slavic \u043f\u044c\u043f\u044c\u0440\u044f\u043d\u044a, an adjective from Old East Slavic \u043f\u044c\u043f\u044c\u0440\u044c 'pepper', which makes it etymologically similar or related to German Pfefferkuchen. In Germany, ginger was added to Christmas or Easter cookies \u2013 this is how the first gingerbread, or \"lebkuchen\", appeared.  In France, the inventor of gingerbread is considered to be Gregory of Nikopol, who in 992 allegedly moved to this country from Armenia and taught the local monks this recipe.\n\nSee also\nGingerbread\nLebkuchen\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Pryaniki at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "A Shrewsbury cake or Shrewsbury biscuit is a classic English dessert, named after Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire. They are made from dough that contains sugar, flour, egg, butter and lemon zest; dried fruit is also often added. Shrewsbury cakes can be small in size for serving several at a time, or large for serving as a dessert in themselves.\n\nHistory\nThe earliest known written reference for Shrewsbury cakes dates to 1602. The original cakes, delicate and fragile in texture, are no longer made commercially. These cakes were very different from the modern Shrewsbury biscuits which are still handcrafted in Shrewsbury.\nThe playwright William Congreve mentioned Shrewsbury cakes in his play The Way of the World in 1700 as a simile (Witwoud - \"Why, brother Wilfull of Salop, you may be as short as a Shrewsbury cake, if you please. But I tell you 'tis not modish to know relations in town\").The recipe is also included in several early cookbooks including The Compleat Cook of 1658, which gives the following instructions:\nTake two pound of floure dryed in the oven and weighed after it is dryed, then put to it one pound of butter that must be layd an hour or two in rose-water, so done poure the water from the butter, and put the butter to the flowre with the yolks and whites of five eggs, two races of ginger, and three quarters of a pound of sugar, a little salt, grate your spice, and it well be the better, knead all these together till you may rowle the past, then roule it forth with the top of a bowle, then prick them with a pin made of wood, or if you have a comb that hath not been used, that will do them quickly, and is best to that purpose, so bake them upon pye plates, but not too much in the oven, for the heat of the plates will dry them very much, after they come forth of the oven, you may cut them without the bowles of what bignesse or what fashion you please.\nAlthough there are earlier references, Shrewsbury baker Thomas Plimmer claimed that he had acquired the original recipe from James Palin, who sold the cakes out of a bakeshop on Castle Street in Shrewsbury.\nThe recipe also appears in early American recipe collections. One 19th century American recipe is made with the creaming method to combine butter and sugar, typical for butter cakes, then adding eggs, rosewater, flour and nutmeg.\n\nOther countries\nShrewsbury biscuits are popular in India, where they are locally produced in the Kayani Bakery located in Pune, Maharashtra.\n\nSee also\nGeographically indicated foods of the United Kingdom\nList of cakes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistory\nRecipe\nRecipe on BBC",

        "body": "The B&M Baked Beans factory is an historic cannery building in Portland, Maine, USA. Constructed in 1913 in the East Deering neighborhood, it was built by the Burnham & Morrill Company. Baked beans were produced in the building until 2021. The building is a prominent landmark highly visible from Interstate 295. It is located at 1 Beanpot Circle.\n\nHistory\nThe Burnham and Morrill Co. began in 1867 on Franklin Street in Portland as a canning factory for vegetables, meat, and fish. The company constructed the B&M Baked Beans factory in 1913. The factory first produced canned beans in 1927. It used a traditional open-pot baking process with iron cauldrons that weighed 200 pounds attached to a ceiling-mounted rail system. The cauldrons were filled with beans, molasses, and other ingredients on the top floor of the factory and baked for hours. The cooked beans were dumped into a chute and went down to the canning line.In 2021, owner B&G Foods Inc. announced that the B&M Baked Beans factory would close. In August of that year the company removed the factory's brick smoke stack. In 2023, the new owner Roux Institute began demolition of ancillary factory buildings to make way for the construction of the Roux Institute campus. The red B&M Brick Oven Baked Beans sign was removed from the building in September 2023. \nThe closure of the plant moved the production of the baked beans to the midwest.\n\nProducts\nProducts manufactured at the factory included multiple flavors of baked beans. The flavors were original, vegetarian, home style, country style, Boston style, bacon and onion, and maple flavor. The factory also made B&M brown bread, which comes in a can in plain and raisin flavors. B&M Baked Beans are made with pea beans. By late 2022, after production moved to the midwest, B&M customers were reporting that the baked beans were undercooked, crunchy, and tasted different. Customers speculated that the beans were no longer being baked. Some customers were hoarding B&M bean cans produced at the Portland plant.\n\nRoux Institute\nAfter its closure, it was sold to Northeastern University, which plans to develop the Roux Institute on the 13.5 acre property. In 2022, it was designated a landmark by the City of Portland. In 2023, the Portland City Council voted to rezone the property from industrial to mixed use and create an institutional overlay zone. Within five years, the institute expects to have built up to 250 units of housing on the site, and up to 650 units within 20 years.Until its new campus is built, the Roux Institute operates out of a leased office building at 100 Fore Street. It has an enrollment of 500 students.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Boston baked beans are a variety of baked beans, sweetened with molasses, and flavored with salt pork or bacon.\n\nHistory\nNative Americans had made corn bread and baked beans. The Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony learned these recipes in the early 1620s and likely added barley to the corn meal to invent New England brown bread. The triangular trade of slaves in the 18th century helped to make Boston an exporter of rum, which is produced by the distillation of fermented molasses. At that time, molasses was added to local baked bean recipes, creating a distinctive style of baked beans unique to New England. \nIn colonial New England, baked beans were traditionally cooked on Saturdays and left in brick ovens overnight. On Sundays, the beans were still hot, allowing people to indulge in a hot meal and still comply with Sabbath restrictions. Brown bread and baked beans along with frankfurters continue to be a popular Saturday night staple throughout the region.\n\nRegional varieties\nThe region has two main styles of baked beans: Boston baked beans and Maine baked beans. The difference between the two styles is that Boston beans are made with small white navy beans or pea beans with thin skin while Maine beans are made with native bean varieties with thicker skins.  The varieties used in Maine are Marafax, soldier, and yellow-eye, with yellow-eye being the most popular variety.Both varieties are often made with salt pork or bacon. However, there is also a long tradition of vegetarian baked beans made with the same recipe as Boston baked beans or Maine baked beans but made without the addition of salt pork or bacon.\n\nLegacy\nBoston is often referred to as \u201cBeantown\u201d in reference to the popular dish. From 1883 to 1906 the National League baseball team in Boston was known as the Boston Beaneaters. An annual tournament between the ice hockey teams of four Boston-area universities is named the Beanpot. \nThis dish is thought to have inspired the common Quebec dish F\u00e8ves au lard.\n\nSee also\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nOriginal Boston Baked Beans, a candy by the Ferrara Candy Company\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Bush Brothers and Company is a family-owned corporation best known for its Bush's Best brand canned baked beans. The company produces approximately 80 percent of the canned baked beans consumed in the United States, representing estimated annual sales in excess of $400 million and the processing of more than 55 million pounds of beans per year. In addition, the company also offers other canned beans (black, garbanzo, pinto, and refried), as well as peas, hominy, and cut green beans. Based in Knoxville, Tennessee, Bush Brothers operates plants in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. Its canned goods are sold through retail food outlets and food service operators throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nHistory\nIn 1904, A.J. (Andrew Jackson) Bush entered a partnership with the Stokely family to open a tomato cannery in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. His cannery proved so profitable that, by 1908, he was able to buy out the Stokelys' interest and establish his own independent business. He entered into partnership with his two oldest sons, Fred and Claude, and established Bush Brothers & Company.\n\nIncorporation and expansion (1922\u20131935)\nIn 1922, A.J. Bush took out a $945 loan on his life insurance policy and used his bank line of credit to incorporate his business. Bush Brothers & Company was incorporated in June 1922, and Fred Bush, A.J.'s oldest son, was named president. (Fred was also a director of the National Canners Association, the primary industry trade group for canning companies.)The company's canning operations originally began with laborious, manual processes, then expanded with steam-powered engines, and eventually evolved into electric-powered factory machinery.During the 1920s, Bush Brothers & Company began expanding its operations to include products other than tomatoes. The company constructed a small canning factory in Clinton, Tennessee, in 1923, and began canning both tomatoes and peaches in 1924. In 1928 the company expanded into corn and hominy, and leased the Smith Brothers & Company's Oak Grove corn processing plant just outside Dandridge, Tennessee. In 1930, Bush Brothers opened a new plant in LaFollette, Tennessee, where it processed blueberries in addition to tomatoes.As the company continued to grow, the original cannery in Chestnut Hill became insufficient to meet its needs. Bush Brothers constructed a new building nearby in 1929, which became the company's main canning facilities for many years.In 1933, Bush Brothers began offering pork and beans, canned under its Chestnut Hill label. The success of their product led to a contract with Armour and Company and to a wide array of canned meats. The company also started up a canning line for Tony Dog and Cat Food, which it continued to sell until the 1980s.By 1935, Bush Brothers were seeing significant expansion and were highlighted in newspaper articles for canning ten million cans of vegetables a year, operating 2000 acres of company-owned farmland, and contracting with 500 farmers to supply vegetables.\n\nProperties lost to Tennessee Valley Authority (1942\u20131948)\nIn 1942, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced the closing of the Douglas Dam floodgates within the year. The end result would be the flooding of the French Broad River bottom, where Bush Brothers had a number of farms. After several months of negotiation, Bush Brothers & Company agreed to sell seven prime tracts of their farmland to the TVA, as well as the Oak Grove Canning Plant.In October 1944, Bush Brothers attempted to offset some of their farmland loss by purchasing the Blytheville Canning Company in Arkansas. However, the plant was in bad shape and struggled during its first four years of Bush ownership. Claude Bush moved to Arkansas in 1948 to oversee the facilities and eventually managed to turn it into a profitable business.\n\nExpansion and change (1946\u20131965)\nFollowing A.J. Bush's death in 1946, Bush Brothers & Company made the move from private label to branded presence. They began offering their goods under the newly developed Bush's Best logo and label. With the advents of supermarkets and television advertising, the 1950s proved very profitable for the company. During this time, they continued to offer a variety of canned vegetables, particularly green beans. They also began offering the dry bean products for which they would eventually become known. In 1952, the company introduced their Great Northern Beans with Plain Sauce. This was followed in 1953 by Mexican Style Beans in Chili Gravy.Claude Bush became president of the company in 1959, following the death of his older brother Fred. Bush Brothers & Company had amassed a substantial amount of cash and accounts receivable under Fred, and Claude felt the money would best be put to use expanding the company's business into new areas. The 1960s saw the purchase of several canning plants, including Shiocton Kraut Company (Shiocton, Wisconsin), Hyde Park Canning Company (Muskogee, Oklahoma), an unused canning plant in Augusta, Wisconsin, and Valley Canning Sweet Potato plants in Ville Platte and Cecilia, Louisiana. Bush Brothers & Company also created its own truck line, Tennessee Truck Lines, in 1962.In 1965, Claude became chairman of the board, and brother-in-law C.J. Ethier succeeded him as President.\n\nBush's Best Baked Beans (1969\u20131978)\nThe year 1969 proved to be a tough one for the canning industry due to overproduction and low prices. As the family stockholders considered their options and discussed strategies for riding out the tough times ahead, Claude's son Condon Bush hit on the idea of offering a new product that would appeal to a wide audience as well as keep his Augusta plant busy during the off season. Inspired by the company's earlier success with pork and beans, Condon decided to develop a baked bean product based on his mother Kathleen's secret recipe.\nThe experiment proved far more successful than the Bush family had ever imagined. Sales of Bush's Best Baked Beans went from ten thousand cases in 1969 to a hundred thousand in 1970, eventually hitting close to a million cases in 1971. Baked beans became a very popular dish during the United States Bicentennial, and so Bush Brothers decided to devote all of their resources to Bush's Best Baked Beans sales. Their campaign was a success, with sales increasing by 173% in 1976, and an additional 34% in 1977.In 1978, Claude stepped down as chairman of the board, and C.J. Ethier replaced him. Condon was elected as the new president of Bush Brothers & Company.\n\nAcquisition of Dubon (1979\u20131993)\nIn 1979, Bush Brothers acquired the Dubon brand of canned foods when that company was sold, following bankruptcy. Canned vegetables, such as carrots, peas, and beets are sold primarily in the Louisiana and New Orleans areas as a regional brand.Throughout the 1980s, Bush Brothers continued to make its transition to a branded producer of table-ready products. However, the shift was slow and fraught with tension as the family had trouble agreeing on the best course of action. After the death of C.J. Ethier in 1989 and Claude Bush in 1990, Jim Ethier (C.J.'s son) convinced Condon (president and CEO) and Allen Bush (vice president of sales) to consult with Dr. Leon Danco of the Center for Family Business. Under Dr. Danco's guidance, Bush Brothers & Company reorganized its board of directors to include members from outside the family and the company. The restructured Board included Jay Carr (The Hershey Company), Bob Johnston (Gerber Products Company), Bill Trubeck (White & Case), and Clay Mathile (The Iams Company).With the new board in place, the company turned to the task of hiring professional sales managers. Office space in Chestnut Hill was filled to capacity, and the prospect of recruiting young, urban managers to such a rural location seemed unlikely. In 1991, Bush Brothers & Company moved its company headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee.In 1992, Jim Ethier was elected president and COO of Bush Brothers & Company. Condon Bush moved to the position of CEO and chairman of the board.\n\nJay Bush (and Duke) (1993\u2013present)\nIn 1993, Bush Brothers & Company hired a small advertising company in Atlanta, Georgia, called Cole, Henderson, Drake (CHD) to develop a new advertising campaign for their line of baked beans. The new ad focused on the \"secret family recipe\", and introduced Jay Bush (Condon's son) as the company's spokesperson. The ad performed well in test markets in 1993, and was released nationally in May 1994.In the summer 1995, a new ad paired Jay up with a mischievous, talking golden retriever named Duke. Modeled after Bush's real-life pet golden retriever of the same name at the time (the dog itself experienced stage fright and was not properly camera-trained), the campaign was created by CHD copywriter David Garzotto and was a huge hit for Bush Brothers, who saw a dramatic spike in baked bean sales. The popularity of the company's baked beans can be directly attributed to the success of the Jay Bush and Duke commercials; as well as its catchphrase \"Roll that beautiful bean footage!\" to market their products, which are made according to the secret family recipe with specially cured bacon, brown sugar, and a secret blend of spices. All the while, Jay is able to keep Duke from selling the secret family recipe, another running gag in the ads. As a result of the ad campaign, the duo became celebrities, and sales of the company's beans increased from a 48% national market share to 80%. The popularity of the commercial inspired the company to publish a children's book, Duke Finds a Home, published in 2006.In 2012, comedian Julie Klausner tweeted a suggestion that Bush Brothers offer a poetry contest, allowing the winner to pet Duke, who she had seen in a television commercial. The request was reiterated by numerous individuals on various social media sites and inspired an informal online petition to the company.On June 27, 2018, Sam, one of the dogs who played Duke on screen, was put to sleep after being diagnosed with cancer. The role had already been recast several years before his death.\n\nRecent years\nThe new Bush Visitor Center is an expansion from founder A.J. Bush's original General Store in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee, and includes a museum, retail shop and caf\u00e9. It also houses  the guarded display of the \"Bush's Secret Family Recipe\" book.Bush's Racing sponsor the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series #47 Chevy Camaro of JTG Daugherty Racing team, formerly driven by Bobby Labonte, and now driven by Ricky Stenhouse Jr.Bush Brothers and Company also sponsors the annual Bean and Bacon Days festival in Augusta, Wisconsin, where the company acquired the old Augusta canning factory in 1961.\nOn Oprah, in 2009, Kristian Bush, great-grandson of A.J. Bush and half of the band Sugarland, mentioned that he no longer liked beans because he grew up on them.\n\nBrands\nBush's\nBush's Best\nBush's Showboat Pork and Beans\nBlue Lake Cut Green Beans\nTony Dog Food\nTony Dog and Cat Food\nDubon Premier\n\nSee also\nList of food companies\nBaked beans\nBeans\nCanning\nDiarrhea Planet; drummer Ian Bush is a member of the Bush family\nList of American advertising characters\nList of mascots\nNational Canners Association\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

It is usually based on the common bean mixed with pieces of bacon and either molasses or maple syrup that is then slow cooked in the oven. Sometimes other ingredients are added. F\u00e8ves au lard are usually served as a side during breakfast, but they can also be served as a side during lunch or supper and they can be served as a meal. F\u00e8ves au lard is a traditional dish presented at sugar shacks during le temps des sucres in Qu\u00e9bec and other French-speaking regions of Canada.\nThis dish was inspired by cultural exchanges between Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and New Englanders during the 19th century. It is believed that Boston baked beans directly inspired F\u00e8ves au lard.  It is also thought that this popular recipe, which uses small white beans, was what caused the gourgane bean to fall out of favour in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\nBineries\nSome establishments call themselves \"Bineries\" because they consider F\u00e8ves au lard and other baked bean dishes a specialty of theirs. An example of this is La Binerie Mont-Royal, a restaurant in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCuisine of Quebec\nSugar shack\n\nReferences\nWeb references\nBibliography\nJean-Marie Franc\u0153ur, Gen\u00e8se de la cuisine qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. \u00c0 travers ses grandes et ses petites histoires, Montr\u00e9al, Fides, 2011, 608 p.

        "body": "Bougatsa (Greek: \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 [bu\u02c8\u0263atsa]) is a Greek breakfast food (sweet or savoury), or mid-morning snack, or midday snack. Bougatsa has several versions with their own filling, with the most popular the bougatsa krema (bougatsa cream) that has semolina custard filling uses as a sweet food and dessert.\n\nOrigin\nThe name comes from the Byzantine Greek \u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 (pog\u00e1tsa), from the ancient Roman p\u0101nis foc\u0101cius, literally \"hearth bread\"; cf. Italian focaccia. It may have had a classical origin in the Ancient Greek/Roman placenta cake. A similar dessert is still known as placenta (Greek: \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) on the island of Lesbos in Greece. Placenta is a type of pancake, made from two layers of dough, usually filled with cottage cheese. Sometimes chocolate or apples are used instead. The cake is covered with honey, before being baked.It was brought in the 20th century, in the early 1920s, by Greek refugees leaving Constantinople when it was still belonged to the Greeks to the region of Northern Greece, particularly in the Central Macedonia, the city of Serres and city of Thessaloniki. Today, bougatsa can be found in Greece in specialty shops called bougatsadika or bougatsopolia, selling bougatsa exclusively.\nThe taste of bougatsa varies between regions of Greece. For example, bougatsa cream in Veria is very sweet and full of cream, while in Thessaloniki the bougatsa cream is crunchy and not that sweet, and in Chania Crete the bougatsa cheese is made of local mizithra cheese and sprinkled with sugar.\n\nPreparation\nTraditional Greek bougatsa is prepared from hand-made phyllo dough wrapped around a filling. After it is baked about 30-35 minutes in the oven, it is cut into small pieces and served hot on small plate. The bougatsa cream is filled with semolina custard, it is then cut into small pieces and served hot is topped with lightly dusted powdered icing sugar and/or cinnamon.\nThe bougatsa recipe parts are, preparing the custard filling, phyllo pastry also known as filo where place about 5 sheets of the buttered pastry in a baking dish, assembling the bougatsa, preheat oven to the correct temperature and bake thereafter until phyllo dough reaches the desired golden-brown crispnessit, cut the bougatsa hot into small portions and serve.Most modern bougatsa is made with machine-made phyllo, but some cafes and bakeries selling hand-made bougatsa still exist, especially in smaller towns and villages of Greece.\nThere are several bougatsa food versions which have their own filling, with the most known are:\nBougatsa cream, that has semolina custard, that is a sweet food and dessert\nBougatsa cheese, with feta cheese that is a savoury food\nBougatsa cheese, with mizithra cheese\nBougatsa chocolate cream,\nBougatsa apple,\nBougatsa potato pur\u00e9e\nBougatsa spinach\nBougatsa mix of spinach and feta cheese\n\u0392ougatsa minced meat, usually a mix of beef and pork or beef and lamb\n\nTrivia\nThe city of Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008. It weighed 182.2 kg (402 lb), was 20 metres (66 ft) long, and was made by more than 40 bakers.The process of making bougatsa by hand-made filo was featured on an episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations filmed in Greece.\n\nSee also\nGalaktoboureko\nSpanakopita, a pie made with spinach and sometimes cheese\nTyropita, a pie made with cheeseBanitsa, a similar pie from Bulgaria\nCremeschnitte\nFocaccia\nKnafeh\nPoga\u010da\nList of custard desserts\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Grandma Brown's Baked Beans, also known as simply Grandma Brown Beans, was a brand name of canned baked beans that was founded by Grandma Lulu Brown in 1937.\n\nHistory\nLulu Manwring Brown was born in Dansville, NY, in 1875.  She attended Mexico Academy after her family moved to Mexico.  She taught in local country schools and married Earl L. Brown in 1896.\nMrs. Brown\u2019s baked beans were always a favorite at the church suppers and other community affairs.  In 1937, Mrs. Brown decided to try to sell her baked beans to supplement the family income.  The local grocery stores agreed to display pans of beans and began to see the product by the pound.  And so, Mrs. Brown, at the age of 63, began her successful career in the business world.\nThe business began using two oil-burning stoves in the kitchen behind Mrs. Brown\u2019s dress shop.  Her husband and son, Robert, were soon involved with the business.  They began delivering the beans not only in Mexico but going to Oswego as well.\nEarl Brown died unexpectedly on Christmas day 1938, before the end of the first year of the business. Mrs. Brown found the inner strength to continue with her growing business.  At this time Richard Whitney joined the firm and BWB Foods, Inc. was formed.  The successful partnership soon covered 75 mile radius, and then a 100-mile radius.  The two stoves increased to 18 and the business moved to the second floor of what is now the public library.  More people were hired to drive trucks and to help Mrs. Brown with the baking.\nThe biggest problem facing the young company was the spoilage.  Together the three members of BWB Foods worked to find a way to put the special beans in cans.  By 1947 the problems were resolved and Grandma Brown\u2019s Home Banked Beans appeared in cans.  This meant the selling area could be greatly increased and could now be carried into neighboring states.  In 1947 the present large modern plant was built.  As Mrs. Brown advanced in years and the business grew, she turned more of the work over to her family in the bean kitchen.  She had earned the respect of the community and when she died in August 1950, at the age of 75, all businesses and stores closed during the funeral services, paying a final tribute to this fine lady.\nIn 1937, Grandma Lulu Brown made large pots of baked beans during the Great Depression to be sold at local grocery stores. However, these beans were so popular that Lulu and Earl Brown, her husband, decided to expand to Oswego, New York.\nOver the years, the company was then known as Brown Whitney Brown (BWB), when Earl Brown died, Richard Whitney joined the company, and soon after, a plant was established in Mexico, New York to process the large quantities of the beans.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Heinz Baked Beans are a brand of baked beans produced by the H.J. Heinz Company. They have been sold as \"Heinz Beanz\" in the United Kingdom since 2008.\n\nHistory\nIn 1886, Heinz Baked Beans were first sold at the Fortnum & Mason department store in London. After opening its first overseas office in London in 1896, the company opened its first UK factory in Peckham, south London, in 1905. This was followed by a second factory at Harlesden, north-west London in 1919. Production was started at a former munitions factory at Standish, near Wigan, in 1946. A new factory opened in Kitt Green, also near Wigan, in 1958.Between 1941 and 1948, The Ministry of Food classified Heinz Baked Beans as an \"essential food\" as part of its wartime rationing system.The Heinz factory in Kitt Green is one of the largest food factories in Europe, and produces more than one billion cans of food every year.\n\nAdvertising slogan\nIn 1967, Heinz launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Beanz Meanz Heinz\". The phrase was created by advertising executive Maurice Drake and went on to become one of the best-known advertising slogans in the United Kingdom. Drake later said the slogan was \"written over two pints of beer in The Victoria pub in Mornington Crescent\". Drake died on 22 August 2021, at the age of 93.In 1998, Heinz Baked Beans was voted one of 12 brands that citizens of the United Kingdom think best represents the final 10 years of the millennium.In 2008, \"Heinz Baked Beans\" were renamed \"Heinz Beanz\", as the original title was \"a bit of a mouthful to pronounce\", according to the company.In 2016, Heinz's advertising campaign featuring people using empty beans cans as musical instruments was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority on safety grounds.\n\nBPA allegations\nIn 2001, the UK's Food Standards Agency found Heinz canned baked beans was one of a number of well-known canned products to be contaminated with the hormone disruptor bisphenol A (BPA). This chemical forms part of the membrane that lines the cans. The Heinz company put out a statement \u2013 \"Although UK and European food authorities have stated that minute levels of BPA in can coatings are safe, Heinz remains committed to moving to alternatives.\" By 2019, Heinz UK claimed to have switched to non-BPA cans for most of its products such as most popular varieties of beans.\n\nProduction method\nHeinz Baked Beans are produced by sealing raw haricot beans and tomato sauce in the cans, which are then placed in large pressure cookers. This gives the sauce its thick consistency and ensures a long shelf life for the product.A standard 415g can will contain an average of 465 beans.\n\nBeanz Museum\nHeinz opened the Beanz Museum as a pop-up exhibit in Covent Garden, London, between 30 August and 1 September 2019. It contained an interactive immersive exhibit about the history of Heinz Baked Beans to mark their 150th anniversary.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

        "body": "SPC Global Limited, formerly SPC Ardmona, is an  Australian-based global agribusiness that specialises in food manufacturing, in particular large fruit processing and packing and owns and operates a factory in Shepparton and is one of the biggest employers in the Goulburn Valley region.\n\nHistory\nStarted in 1917 by a group of fruit growers in Victoria\u2019s Goulburn Valley as a cooperative which they named the Shepparton Fruit Preserving Co. Ltd. The company began operations in February 1918, canning pears, peaches and nectarines under the brand name of SPC.  SPC was incorporated as a public listed company in 1912, and Ardmona opened in 1921.SPC Ardmona was formed in 2002 by the merger of the former Shepparton Preserving Company (SPC) and Ardmona.SPC Ardmona was bought by Coca-Cola Amatil in 2005 for A$750 million. In that time, CCA had also invested about A$250 million in infrastructure, and the Victorian government had provided A$22 million in co-investment.It acquired IXL and Taylors brands in 2004,. \nSPCA closed its Mooroopna processing plant in 2011 and it's Kyabram factory was sold in 2019.Coca-Cola Amatil sold SPC in 2019 for A$40 million to Shepparton Partners Collective, now known as SPC Global Limited who implemented strategies for global growth.SPC Global carries the SPC, Goulburn Valley,  Ardmona, Provital, Pomlife and Helping Humans brands.\nIn August 2021, SPC Global mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for all staff, contractors, and visitors by November to be allowed entry to all their offices and factory sites. It announced it would provide staff paid vaccination leave and up to two days of special leave to recover if they became unwell after receiving the shot. With that, it became the first Australian company to mandate vaccines for all onsite staff and visitors.Currently, Hussein Rifai is the Chairman of the Company. Since 2023, Neil Brimacombe is CEO.\n\nFormer Financial problems\nSPC Ardmona lost $25 million in 2013, compared to a $70 million profit 8 years earlier. In 2012, SPCA disposed $100 million of fruit bought under contract because it could not be sold, blaming it on \"plummeting\" local and export orders. A former Coca-Cola Asia executive, Peter Kelly, went to the company in April 2013 to attempt to turn it around.In October 2013, SPCA sought A$50 million financial assistance from the Federal and Victorian governments to modernise its operation. It wanted the Victorian Government to match the Federal grant. In early 2014, SPCA sought $25 million of Federal government assistance as part of a plan to upgrade the Shepparton cannery which was rejected. Shortly afterwards however, the Victorian Government announced that $22 million would be provided.In November 2016, Woolworths ended its contract with SPCA for the supply of tinned tomatoes and would not renew it. However, the five-year deal to provide tinned fruit was ongoing.\n\nTurnaround & Growth\nIn June 2019, it was announced that Coca-Cola Amatil had sold the SPC business to a group called Shepparton Partners Collective, now known as SPC Global Limited, for $40 million. Shepparton Partners Collective was a joint venture between Perma Funds Management, a boutique investment house, and The Eights, a private equity firm. The sale was subject to a four-year deferred payment which, subject to business performance, could generate a further $15 million for Coca-Cola on top of the money paid up-front. As part of the turnaround strategy, the business sold the IXL and Taylors brands with the Kyabram factory in 2019 to a group of farmers and growers in the Goulburn Valley.In 2021, SPC introduced the manufacturing and distribution of healthy beverages through its new acquisitions of the brand, Helping Humans, and ready to eat meals through, the Kuisine Co. and The Good meal Co.\nIn the 2020-21 Financial Year, SPC reported a consolidated profit after tax of AUD 11.8 million. In 2021-22 it returned a consolidated profit after tax of AUD 24 million.\n\nSPC Football Club\nThe SPC Football Club won the 1945 Goulburn Valley Football Association \u2013 Lightning Premiership which was held on the King's Birthday public holiday.SPC were runners up to Shepparton East in the 1945 Goulburn Valley Football Association grand final.SPC defeated Numurkah in the 1948 Central Goulburn Valley Football League's seconds grand final. and in 1949 SPC were defeated by Shepparton in the 1949 Central Goulburn Valley Football League's senior football grand final.SPC merged with Shepparton East in 1950 to form City United, later named the Shepparton United Football Club and entered a senior team in Goulburn Valley Football League.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\"New Woolworths & SPC Partnership A Win For Industry And Aussie Growers\" (PDF).

It is prepared with fresh beans and can be found in many restaurants in North Macedonia. It is also commonly eaten by the Macedonian diaspora. This meal is baked and served in a traditional unglazed earthenware pot. The name of the dish may be translated as \"beans on a tava\". Tav\u010de grav\u010de is considered the national dish of North Macedonia.  \"Tav\u010de grav\u010de Tetovo style\" is a popular regional variation.\n\nIngredients\nThe basic ingredients in tav\u010de grav\u010de are:\n\nbutter beans\nonion\noil\ndry red pepper\nred and black pepper\nsalt\nparsley\n\nPreparation\nThe beans are cleaned and then soaked in cold water \u2013 preferably overnight, but, if time is an issue, they may be soaked for several hours or until the beans have become soft. The water in which the beans have been soaked must be discarded and fresh water added, before the beans are brought slowly to the boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one hour. After the first boiling, the water is again discarded, the beans washed and yet more fresh water added before they are boiled for a second time. This changing of the water at several points in the cooking process makes the beans more digestible by leaching out of them some of the indigestible sugars that can often cause flatulence. A whole onion is then added to the boiling water with the beans. When the beans are boiled, the boiled onion is removed from the water, fried separately with a scoop of flour and a teaspoon of ground red paprika, and then returned to the boiled beans. Salt, black pepper, and/or the ubiquitous regional seasoning salt Vegeta may be added to the soup. Some cooks may also add dried meats such as smoked pork, bacon or suho meso to the mix. When the beans are boiled and when all the ingredients have been added, they are put in an earthenware pot covered with a lid and baked in an oven at 220 \u00b0C. During the baking, the beans must be checked carefully from time to time to ensure that they do not become dry.\nThe traditional earthenware pot not only gives the dish a pleasingly rustic appearance when it is served, piping hot, from the oven, but also keeps it hot and, if used regularly and kept in good condition, can even impart a special flavour to the dish \u2013 in much the same way that the traditional unglazed earthenware cazuela can do.\n\nSee also\nList of legume dishes\n North Macedonia portal\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Van Camp's is an American brand of canned bean products currently owned by ConAgra Foods, Inc. Their products typically consist of beans stewed in a flavored sauce. Van Camp's has for some time been the second-best selling brand of baked beans in the United States, competing with Bush's Baked Beans.\n\nFounding\nThe brand traces its roots back to Indianapolis, where in 1861 Gilbert Van Camp and associates Calvin Fletcher and Martin Williams constructed what became the nation's first successful commercial cold storage warehouse. Primarily concerned with the preservation of fruits and vegetables, Van Camp quickly began experimenting with canning. By 1862 he had started to can fruits and vegetables in the summertime for winter consumption. Shortly thereafter, Van Camp secured a lucrative contract to supply Union troops during the Civil War.Van Camp's pork and beans quickly became a wartime staple. Following the war, demand for canned food soared as returning veterans were eager to purchase the food that they had become familiar with.  In 1882 the Van Camp Packing Company was founded. They started selling catsup in 1888.In 1894, his son Frank Van Camp first produced the now-famous recipe for pork and beans in tomato sauce.  By 1898 the Van Camp Packing Company had increased annual production to six million cans.  By 1909 Indiana, bolstered by the Van Camp family's company, became the nation's leading producer of canned baked beans.  Frank Van Camp went on to found Van Camp Seafood.\n\nCompany history\nThe firm is considered to have been a trendsetter in the canned-foods industry.  In 1933, it was acquired by James and John Stokely, who operated the Stokely canned tomato company in Newport, Tennessee, forming Stokely-Van Camp, Inc. The resultant combined company headquartered in Indianapolis.  In the 1940s, the company built two warehouses in Bellingham, Washington. By the 1970s, Stokely-Van Camp agreed to produce, market and distribute a new beverage called Gatorade.  This product was the first sports drink, and would eventually generate more in sales than the rest of SVC's other products combined.\n\nSale and brand history\nIn 1983, the brand passed to the Quaker Oats Company when it purchased Stokely-Van Camp. Quaker Oats sold Van Camp's to ConAgra in 1995. Stokely was sold to Seneca Foods in 1985 and currently produces canned beans and other canned vegetables.\nOver the years, a number of foods have been sold under the Van Camp's name, including its popular Tenderoni pasta product. as of 2005 it only sells canned cooked beans, including pork and beans, baked beans, kidney beans, a vegetarian variant of its pork and bean recipe, Chili and \"Beanee Weenee\"\u2014a mixture of beans with slices of frankfurter made of beef and chicken in tomato sauce.\n\nSee also\nGilbert Van Camp\nTenderoni\nStokely-Van Camp Industrial Complex\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

There is a similar recipe in the Llibre del Coch by Rupert de Nola for almadrote, a similar recipe for a sauce made with garlic, eggs, cheese and broth that was served with partridge. In modern usage it refers to an oil, garlic and cheese sauce served with eggplant casserole.\nAlmadrote may have pre-Inquisition Sephardic origins and served with eggplant has become widespread in modern Turkish cuisine.Earlier recipes for almodrote may date recipes for a type of green sauce called moretum (believed to be the etymological origin of almodrote) in the Apicius, or it may be of Arabic etymology. Concerning the latter, the evidence is based on modern lexicographical studies; it's not used for any of the sauces found in the 13th-century Andalusian cookbook, but may be derived from the Arabic term alma\u1e6dr\u00faq meaning to pound.During the Inquisition in the late 15th-century Fray Gon\u00e7alo Bringuylla was reported to have eaten \"eggplant with almadrote\".In a later 16th century cookbook the name of the sauce is altered to capirotada, though garlic is only present in one variation of the sauce. Modern Sephardic cookbooks commonly contain recipes for vegetable casseroles with almodrot and almodrote.

Broas de mel are traditionally consumed at Christmas time (Natal), and in some regions on All Saints' Day (Dia de Todos os Santos).\n\nHistory\nThe giving and receiving of broas de mel traditionally carries a double meaning with the use of two expressions. The first, receber as broas (roughly, to receive the broas) represents the receiving of a gift, usually money. And the second, que ricas broas (roughly, \"what rich/abundant broas\"), contains an irony; for if one has had any problems that require the spending of money, the holidays only become poorer as a result.

        "body": "Salzburger Nockerl (pl., Austro-Bavarian: Soizbuaga Noggal) are a sweet souffl\u00e9 served as a dessert, a culinary specialty in the Austrian city of Salzburg.\n\nRecipe\nThe sweet souffl\u00e9 is made from egg yolk, flour, sugar, and vanilla (or vanilla sugar), mixed into a dough. Next, egg white and granulated sugar are whisked into a meringue until soft peaks form and then mixed into the dough with spatula. Finally, dumplings (Nocken, diminutive: Nockerl, cf. Gnocchi) of the mixture are baked in an oven until lightly brown on the outside (10-12 minutes).Salzburger Nockerl are always freshly prepared and served warm with powdered sugar, sometimes with a raspberry sauce or any other fruit spread layered on the bottom of the souffl\u00e9. Though traditionally a dessert, the dish is filling enough to eat as a main course.\n\nCultural significance\nAlthough presumably derived from French souffl\u00e9 dishes, Salzburger Nockerl, like Kaiserschmarrn or Apple strudel, has become an icon of Austrian cuisine. Legend has it that the dish was invented by Salome Alt (1568\u20131633), the concubine of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau in the early 17th century. In any case, the golden dumplings represent Salzburg's Baroque atmosphere left by the territorial prince, whose life of dissipation came to an end when his archbishopric was challenged by the Bavarian neighbours. They are supposed to represent the hillsides surrounding the city centre: Gaisberg, M\u00f6nchsberg and Kapuzinerberg. The dusting of powdered sugar resembles the snow-covered peaks.Fred Raymond (1900\u20131954) composed in 1938 an operetta called Saison in Salzburg - Salzburger Nockerln (Season in Salzburg - Salzburger Nockerln). In this composition the sweet dumplings are praised as \u201cS\u00fc\u00df wie die Liebe und zart wie ein Kuss\u201d (meaning Sweet as love and tender as a kiss in German).\nThe character David Slater reminisces about the dish cooked by his ex-wife in the 1953 film Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSalzburger Nockerln, entry in the traditional food register of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management\n7 eggs and a lot of air - Salzburger Nockerl",

It is a popular staple food in many homes within South Africa. The bread is prepared in a container in a pot of boiling water. It differs from the traditional dumpling in that it is prepared using yeast instead of baking powder. There are different variations of the dish around South Africa. In the Zulu culture, dombolo is cooked on top of a stew rather than on its own in a separate pot. That variation of the steamed bread is known amongst the Zulus as uJeqe. Dombolo is often consumed with different kinds of side dishes such as chicken stew, beef stew, oxtail stew, lamb stew, or tripe.Dombolo can be made  by using cake flour and placed on top of a stew to soak in the stew's flavours.\nIt is related to Dutch Jan-in-de-zak or broeder.\n\nSee also\nList of steamed foods\nSouth African cuisine\n Food portal\n South Africa portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Chicken Maryland or Maryland chicken is a historic dish associated with the U.S. state of Maryland, but has other meanings from other nations. In its home base, the food dish consists of fried chicken served with a cream gravy. It is traditionally garnished with bananas, which were historically one of Baltimore's leading imports.\n\nHistory and preparation\nMany Maryland families have their own heirloom recipes for this dish, and it remains a regional specialty in Eastern Shore restaurants.\nThe primary factor that distinguishes Maryland fried chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally cast-iron) skillet and covered tightly after the initial browning so that the chicken steams as well as fries. Milk or cream is then added to the pan juices to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic.Escoffier had a recipe for Poulet saut\u00e9 Maryland  in his landmark cookbook Ma Cuisine.\n\nAustralia\nIn Australia, the term \"Chicken Maryland\" simply refers to a butcher's cut for a whole leg consisting of the thigh and drumstick.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nIn some Chinese restaurants in the United Kingdom (particularly in Scotland), Chicken Maryland can be found under the \"European\" or \"British\" section of the menu. It consists of a breaded, deep fried chicken breast served with a slice of bacon, a banana or pineapple fritter (or both) and chips.\n\nSouth America\nIn Argentina and in some neighboring South American countries, Suprema de Pollo Maryland is a pounded thin breast of chicken, breaded and fried, served with creamed corn, peas, bacon (pancetta), French fries and a fried banana.\n\nSee also\nList of regional dishes of the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

The dish is baked in an oven and is usually served with rice and a salad.\nThe dish was invented by Ove Jacobsson, who worked in the air freight industry, hence the name. \nAsked to make the main dish for a neighbourhood potluck in Stockholm in 1976, Jacobsson combined the few ingredients available to him in his refrigerator into a casserole, cooked it, and served it at the party, where it was a hit. His neighbor, Anders Tunberg, worked for Allt om Mat (All about Food) magazine, and thus  the recipe was first published in a Swedish cooking magazine in 1976.\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\nList of chicken dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFlying Jacob, classic Swedish dish",

        "body": "Gratin dauphinois ( GRAT-a doh-fi-NWAH) is a French gratin of sliced raw potatoes baked in cream, from the Dauphin\u00e9 region in south-eastern France. There are many variants of the name of the dish, including pommes de terre dauphinoise, potatoes \u00e0 la dauphinoise and gratin de pommes \u00e0 la dauphinoise.:\u200a725\u200a It is distinguished from ordinary gratin potatoes (potatoes au gratin) by the use of raw rather than boiled potatoes. It is a quite different dish from pommes dauphine.\n\nHistory\nThe first mention of the dish is from 12 July 1788. It was served with ortolans at a dinner given by Charles-Henri, Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre and Lieutenant-general of the Dauphin\u00e9, for the municipal officials of the town of Gap, now in the d\u00e9partement of Hautes-Alpes.:\u200a242\n\nPreparation\nGratin dauphinois is made with thinly sliced raw potatoes and cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic; cheese is sometimes added. The potatoes are peeled and sliced to the thickness of a coin, usually with a mandoline; they are layered in a shallow earthenware or glass baking dish and cooked in a slow oven; the heat is raised for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.:\u200a251\u200a:\u200a337\u200aBy tradition, the gratin dauphinois does not include cheese,:\u200a350\u200a:\u200a151\u200a which would make it more similar to a gratin savoyard (which does not include cream).:\u200a263\u200a Recipes given by many chefs \u2013 including Auguste Escoffier, Austin de Croze and Constance Spry \u2013 call for cheese and eggs;:\u200a251\u200a:\u200a725\u200a:\u200a207\u200a others such as Robert Carrier specify cheese but no egg.:\u200a211\u200aThe gratin dauphinois is distinguished from ordinary gratin potatoes by the use of raw rather than boiled potatoes.:\u200a249\u200a It is a quite different dish from pommes dauphine.:\u200a251\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Hoppel poppel is an egg casserole made with leftovers, a dish associated with frugal housewives.Found in German and Austrian cuisine, the casserole dish is also associated with the Midwestern United States. The basic recipe for the casserole is home fries (fried potatoes), scrambled eggs, and onion. Sometimes it is topped with melted cheese. Other ingredients like green pepper or mushrooms can be added to the basic combination, and a variety of meats can be used including bacon, ham and salami.\n\nDescription\nThe basic form of the dish was just potatoes, onions, meat and scrambled eggs, but more elaborate variations could be devised with green peppers, melted cheese and mushrooms. The meat could be ham, bacon, sausage, or even all-beef salami. Hoppel poppel was served at Jewish delicatessens (despite not strictly adhering to kosher dietary regulations) and these establishments made the dish with all-beef salami.\n\nPreparation\nWith bacon\nTo make Hoppel Popel the first step was to cook the meat in a skillet, then set the cooked meat aside and add the onions to cook in the drippings. The onions were removed from the pan once they took on a golden color, and butter was added to the remaining drippings, then the potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and when they were browned the meat and onions were returned to the pan and the eggs added until the eggs set.\n\nWith beef salami\nAnother way of making hoppel poppel without pork begins by parboiling the potatoes, then slicing them and frying in vegetable oil. Butter is added with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and beef salami. The eggs and whisked with milk and parsley and gently scrambled in the skillet. When the eggs have started to set the cheese topping can be added, and the dish cooked covered for a few more minutes until the cheese has melted and the eggs are fully cooked.\n\nWith boiled beef\nHoppel poppel could also be made with boiled beef to use up leftovers. This version of the dish begins by cooking the boiled beef and onion in butter, with bacon. When the bacon is cooked whisked eggs are added and cooked like an omelette.\n\nWith ham\nFor a hoppel poppel with ham, cubed potatoes and onions were pan-fried in butter until the potatoes were browned, then ham was added to the skillet. Eggs were whisked with cognac, salt and pepper, and Worcestershire sauce and poured into the skillet, cooked gently as an omelette, with fresh parsley. When the omelette is set it was topped with grated cheese and finished in the broiler.\n\nSee also\nBauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck\nStemmelkort\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Hot Mash (English: slang), is a large, deep dish of food cooked within a casserole dish. Hot Mash is a particular variety of casserole whose genesis is generally considered to have originated in the Midwest Continental United States. Although the exact date and creator cannot be pinpointed, articles began mentioning hot mash during the late 1930s and Hot Mash's popularity took off in the 1950s and 1960s after Elvis mentioned it was one of his favorite dishes that his \"momma made [him] when he came home.\"Hot Mash generally consists of a butter base with a chocolate product melted in, pieces of meat (such as beef, chicken, lamb, venison, or even pieces of lake trout), various types of starchy binders like pasta, potatoes, or hash browns, and often a crunchy cheese topping.\n\nEtymology\nHistorians and journalists of the era often cite two possible sources for Hot Mash's unique name. A characteristic Hot Mash generally is very thick when prepared correctly using a condensed soup as the base with the butter and chocolate. This thickness often became the go-to signature of a good Hot Mash, so much so, that local eateries and journalists primarily judge a good Hot Mash based upon the viscosity of the finished product. In a particularly famous exchange, one Hot Mash cook in the Des Moines Register once claimed that his Hot Mash was \"so thick it could fix a pothole better than hot slurry.\"The other predominate theory regarding the etymology of the name deals with the composition of the dish. In preparing Hot Mash, many of the ingredients, especially the starches, will need to be mashed in order to facilitate the dining experience.\n\nInitial reactions\nGiven the unusual mix of sweet and salty flavors, those unfamiliar with Hot Mash tend to exhibit close-minded behaviors and are characterized by rejecting offers of the home-cooked staple.  Since its creation, at least one individual trying Hot Mash has said \"Wow - this is not sweet and salty.  This is sweet, salty, and great!\"  An unaccredited scientific research group is quoted as saying \"the combination of saltiness and sweetness create tasteful synergy.\"\n\nProtein implementation\nIn the late 20th century, those residing within the Tri-State region of the Midwest began substituting the initial cocoa powder ingredient with whey protein.  In time since, athletes have become stronger, faster, and more competitive overall.  It is believed by several that this new Hot Mash recipe is the reason for such.    \n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Natillas (Spanish pronunciation: [na\u02c8ti\u028eas]) is a term in Spanish for a variety of custards and similar sweet desserts in the Spanish-speaking world. In Spain, this term refers to a custard dish made with milk and eggs, similar to other European creams as cr\u00e8me anglaise. In Colombia, the delicacy does not include eggs, and is called natilla.\n\nEtymology\nNatillas is a diminutive of nata (\"cream\", in English), that is, crema de leche (milk cream), referring to the consistency of the dish.\n\nVarieties\nSpain\nIn Spain, natillas is a custard dish typically made with milk, sugar, vanilla, eggs, and\ncinnamon. The dish\nis prepared by gently boiling the milk and slowly stirring in the eggs (often just the yolks) and other ingredients to create a sweet custard. The differences between Spanish natillas, English custard or French cr\u00e8me anglaise are vague, mainly related to their thickness.\nThis custard (a thin pouring cream and not a coagulated custard) is similar to flan but is typically richer, includes cinnamon, and does not include caramel.\n\nNew Mexico\nNew Mexican natillas are derived directly from the recipes of Spain as a result of the Spanish Conquest and the existing Spanish descendants. Such natillas are custard-like in consistency and may, in some recipes, have flour in addition to egg whites. They are not to be confused with Mexican natillas.\n\nColombia\nIn Colombia, natilla is the most popular Christmas dish and is eaten along with bu\u00f1uelos and manjar blanco, and it resembles a flan or pudding. Some of the ingredients include milk, panela (blocks of unrefined cane sugar), cinnamon sticks, and flour or cornstarch. Occasionally people like to add grated coconut, cheese or raisins but these are optional ingredients. To garnish it, powdered cinnamon is spread on top of the finished natilla. Natilla is found all throughout the Christmas season and usually stores sell pre-made natilla, with a variety of flavors including coconut, and arequipe; but one of the best known Christmas traditions in Colombia is making natilla in an improvised campfire in the streets or home patios. Another traditional way of making it includes adding aguardiente or  anisette (anise liqueur) to it.\n\nPeru\nThis term is used in Peru, especially the city of Piura, a spread made of milk and chancaca that is boiled until it is thick and the sugar has caramelized to a rich brown color. The Peruvian confection is arguably more similar to Spanish natilla except that it is somewhat thicker and has no eggs.\n\nMexico\nIn Mexico, Natillas are also found and resemble a thicker version of the dessert drink called \"Atole.\"\n\nCosta Rica\nIn Costa Rica, the term is used for a sour cream-like dairy product used as a condiment with a variety of dishes. The product is homogenized and pasteurized milk with a lower fat content (about 12%) than normal sour cream, some brands add salt to the cream.\n\nCuba\nNatilla in Cuba is classified as a cold custard dessert. Natilla is made with cornstarch, vanilla, sugar, eggs, lemon peel, cinnamon, and evaporated milk. Typically served on Christmas in small cups with cinnamon sprinkled on top.\n\nPuerto Rico\nThere are two versions of this dessert that exist on the island.\nOne version is served for breakfast and cooked stove top in a pot. Served cold or hot, has less or no sugar because it is often served with honey, fruit and nuts.\nAnother version using the same ingredients is served on Christmas and baked in same fashion as cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\nBoth versions include, milk, coconut cream, sugar, a large amount of egg yolks, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla, zest, and orange blossom water.\nPuerto Rican Natilla can be bought all year around in supermarkets and convenient stores as a prepackaged powder with just the requirement of heating with milk.\n\nGuam\nIn Guam, the dish is often called latiya and was likely first introduced in the 17th to 19th centuries. It is often made with canned evaporated or condensed milk.\n\nSee also\nBu\u00f1uelos\nFlan\nHojuelas\nList of custard desserts\nManjar blanco\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Porkkanalaatikko (or, in Swedish, morotsl\u00e5da, both meaning 'carrot casserole') is a traditional Finnish dish mostly eaten during Christmas.\nThe main ingredients are mashed carrots, mixed with boiled rice or barley, and liquid (usually milk or cream). Butter and eggs may be mixed into the mash, which may also be flavoured with sugar, salt, white pepper and grated nutmeg. The mash is put in a casserole dish and baked in the oven. The carrots need not necessarily be boiled before baking: they can be grated and mixed raw with the other ingredients. Readymade porkkanalaatikko is also sold in Finnish food stores around the Christmas season, as well as in parts of Sweden with a large ethnically Finnish population.\nThe dish seems to have originated in the nineteenth century.\n\nSee also\nLanttulaatikko\nList of carrot dishes\nMaksalaatikko\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Qurabiya (also ghraybe, ghorayeba, ghoriba (Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629), ghribia, ghra\u00efba, gurabija or ghriyyaba and numerous other spellings and pronunciations), is a shortbread-type biscuit, usually made with ground almonds. Versions are found in most Arab and Ottoman cuisines, with various different forms and recipes. They are similar to polvorones from Andalusia.In the Maghreb and Egypt, they are often served with Libyan tea, Arabic coffee or Maghrebi mint tea.\n\nHistory\nA recipe for a shortbread cookie similar to ghorayebah but without almonds, called in Arabic khushkan\u0101naj ghar\u012bb (exotic cookie), is given in the earliest known Arab cookbook, the 10th-century Kitab al-\u1e6cab\u012b\u1e2b. Kurabiye appears in the Ottoman cuisine in the 15th century.There is some debate about the origin of the words. Some give no other origin for the Turkish word kurabiye than Turkish, while others have given Arabic or Persian. Among others, linguist Sevan Ni\u015fanyan has given an Arabic origin, in his 2009 book of Turkish etymology, from \u0121urayb or \u011far\u00eeb (exotic). However, as of 2019, Ni\u015fanyan's online dictionary now gives the earliest known recorded use in Turkish as the late 17th century, with an origin from the Persian gul\u0101biya, a cookie made with rose water, from gul\u0101b, related to flowers. He notes that the Syrian Arabic words \u0121ur\u0101biye/\u0121uraybiye likely derive from the Turkish.\n\nRegional variations\nCrimea\nCrimean Tatars (indigenous people of Crimea) call cookies \"khurabie\" (qurabiye, qurabye, \u043a\u044a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0431\u044c\u0435, \u043a\u044a\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0435).\nThe Crimean Tatar \"kurabye\" has many forms, but basically it looks like a rhombus, or a combination of two or three rhombuses to form a flower, or it is cut in the shape of a crescent.\nCrimean Tatars prepare kurabye as follows: powdered sugar is mixed with ghee, and then flour is added.\nThe finished \"khurabye\" is completely sprinkled with powdered sugar on all sides.\n\nAlbania\n[1]\nGurabija\n\nAlgeria\nGhribia (Algerian Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u064a\u0629)\nGhribia with almonds\nGhribia with peanuts\nGhribia with walnuts\nGhribia with pistachios\n\nArmenia\nKhourabia (Armenian: \u0542\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0561\u0562\u056b\u0561) is the Armenian version sometimes referred to in English as Armenian butter cookie or Armenian shortbread cookie. Khourabia was traditionally made with three ingredients: butter, sugar, and flour and usually shaped like bread, wheat ear, or horse shoe signifying health, wealth, and prosperity. It was mostly eaten during the Easter, Christmas, and new year celebrations. Later, more ingredients were added, like eggs, cinnamon, and walnuts.\n\nBulgaria\nKurabii, name of the Bulgarian cuisine and the many varieties of cookie, a popular sweet variety. Especially during the holiday season, and a variety of jams produced via the new year with powdered sugar cookies decorated with cute shapes are called \"maslenki\".\n\nGreece and Cyprus\nThe Greek version, called \"kourabiedes\" or \"kourabiethes\" (Greek: \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2; plural of kourabies \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2), resembles a light shortbread, typically made with almonds. Kourabiedes are sometimes made with brandy, usually Metaxa, for flavouring, though vanilla, mastika or rose water are also popular. In some regions of Greece, Christmas kourabiedes are adorned with a single whole spice clove embedded in each biscuit. Kourabiedes are shaped either into crescents or balls, then baked till slightly golden. They are usually rolled in icing sugar while still hot, forming a rich butter-sugar coating. Kourabiedes are popular for special occasions, such as Christmas or baptisms.The Greek word \"kourabiedes\" comes from the Turkish word kurabiye, which is related to qurabiya, a family of Middle Eastern cookies.\nIn Cyprus, they are often given as gifts to wedding attendees after the ceremony.\n\nIran\nIn Tabriz, Qurabiyas are made of almond flour, sugar, egg white, vanilla, margarine and a topping of coarsely crushed pistachio and almond. It is served by itself or with tea, customarily placed on top of the teacup to make it soft before eating.\n\nKuwait\nVariants including:\nGhoriba with Cardamom\nGhoriba with pistachio\nGhoriba with saffron\n\nLevant\nGhoriba with pistachio\nGhoriba with Rose water\n\nLibya\nGhra\u00efba Libyan Arabic translation : | \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629 \n\nGhoriba with peanuts\nGhoriba with almonds\nGhoriba with walnuts\n\nMorocco\nGhoriba (Moroccan Arabic: \u063a\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e\u0629) in Morocco and other parts of the Maghreb, the popular cookies often use semolina instead of white flour, giving a distinctive crunch.the original Ghriba is made from flour and flavored with lemon or orange zest and cinnamon, this sweet is usually served at parties, accompanied by mint tea or coffee.\nMlouwza, made with almonds and sugar flavored with orange flower water\nGhoriba bahla\nGhoriba dyal zite\nGhoriba mramla\n\nSaudi Arabia\nGhur\u0113ba / Ghr\u0113ba (Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629), variants include:\n\nGhur\u0113ba with pistachio\nGhur\u0113ba with almonds\nGhur\u0113ba with cardamom\n\nTurkey\nThe word kurabiye is used to refer to a variety of biscuits in Turkey, not necessarily local ones, although various types of local kurabiye are made; including ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi and un kurabiyesi.\n\nTunisia\nGhra\u00efba (Tunisian Arabic: \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629)\n\nGhra\u00efba bidha, made with wheat flour\nGhra\u00efba dro\u00f4, made with sorghum flour\nGhra\u00efba homs, made with chickpea flour\n\nSee also\nAlmond cookie\nUn kurabiyesi\nHallongrotta\nKavala Almond Cookies\nMurabbal\u0131 mecidiye\nNankhatai\nOsmania Biscuit\nPanellets\nPolvor\u00f3n\n\u0130zmir Bomb Kurabiye\n\u015eekerpare\nList of almond dishes\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\n\n\n== References ==",

Its name comes from King Ranch, one of the largest ranches in the United States, although the actual history of the dish is unknown and there is no direct connection between the dish and the ranch. Recipes vary, but generally it has a sauce made of canned diced tomatoes with green chiles (commonly the Ro-Tel brand), cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup, diced bell pepper, onion, and chunks or shreds of chicken. The bottom of the casserole is lined with corn tortillas or tortilla chips, then layered with sauce and topped with cheese.  This flavorful Tex-Mex dish has long been a favorite dish in Texas club cookbooks and lunchrooms.\n\nSee also\nList of casserole dishes\nList of chicken dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A cookie (American English) or biscuit (British English) is a baked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat, and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, or nuts.\nMost English-speaking countries call crunchy cookies \"biscuits\", except for the United States and Canada, where \"biscuit\" refers to a type of quick bread. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called \"cookies\" even in the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.\nBiscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes dunked, an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses.\n\nTerminology\nIn many English-speaking countries outside North America, including the United Kingdom, the most common word for a crisp cookie is \"biscuit\". The term \"cookie\" is normally used to describe chewier ones. However, in many regions both terms are used. The container used to store cookies may be called a cookie jar.\nIn Scotland, the term \"cookie\" is sometimes used to describe a plain bun.Cookies that are baked as a solid layer on a sheet pan and then cut, rather than being baked as individual pieces, are called bar cookies in American English or traybakes in British English .\n\nEtymology\nThe word cookie dates from at least 1701 in Scottish usage where the word meant \"plain bun\", rather than thin baked good, and so it is not certain whether it is the same word. From 1808, the word \"cookie\" is attested \"...in the sense of \"small, flat, sweet cake\" in American English. The American use is derived from Dutch koekje \"little cake\",  which is a diminutive of \"koek\" (\"cake\"), which came from the Middle Dutch word \"koke\". Another claim is that the American name derives from the Dutch word koekje or more precisely its informal, dialect variant koekie which means little cake, and arrived in American English with the Dutch settlement of New Netherland, in the early 1600s.According to the Scottish National Dictionary, its Scottish name may derive from the diminutive form  (+ suffix -ie) of the word cook, giving the Middle Scots cookie, cooky or cu(c)kie. There was much trade and cultural contact across the North Sea between the Low Countries and Scotland during the Middle Ages, which can also be seen in the history of curling and, perhaps, golf.\n\nDescription\nCookies are most commonly baked until crisp or else for just long enough to ensure a soft interior. Other types of cookies are not baked at all, such as varieties of peanut butter cookies that use solidified chocolate rather than set eggs and wheat gluten as a binder. Cookies are produced in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits.\nA general theory of cookies may be formulated in the following way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the batter as thin as possible, the better to allow bubbles\u2014responsible for a cake's fluffiness\u2014to form. In the cookie the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether in the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a far higher temperature. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs in place of water is much denser after removal from the oven.\nRather than evaporating as water does in a baking cake, oils in cookies remain. These oils saturate the cavities created during baking by bubbles of escaping gases. These gases are primarily composed of steam vaporized from the egg whites and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not render soggy the food it has soaked into.\n\nHistory\nCookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they survive travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors. The first documented instance of the figure-shaped gingerbread man was at the court of Elizabeth I of England in the 16th century. She had the gingerbread figures made and presented in the likeness of some of her important guests.With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion, a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names, was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.\nCookies came to America through the Dutch in New Amsterdam in the late 1620s. The Dutch word \"koekje\" was Anglicized to \"cookie\" or cooky. The earliest reference to cookies in America is in 1703, when \"The Dutch in New York provided...'in 1703...at a funeral 800 cookies...'\"The modern form of cookies, which is based on creaming butter and sugar together, did not appear commonly until the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution in Britain and the consumers it created saw cookies (biscuits) become products for the masses, and firms such as Huntley & Palmers (formed in 1822), McVitie's (formed in 1830) and Carr's (formed in 1831) were all established. The decorative biscuit tin, invented by Huntley & Palmers in 1831, saw British cookies exported around the world. In 1891, Cadbury filed a patent for a chocolate-coated cookie.\n\nClassification\nCookies are broadly classified according to how they are formed or made, including at least these categories:\n\n Bar cookies consist of batter or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers) and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. In British English, bar cookies are known as \"tray bakes\". Examples include brownies, fruit squares, and bars such as date squares.\nDrop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), oatmeal raisin (or other oatmeal-based) cookies, and rock cakes are popular examples of drop cookies. This may also include thumbprint cookies, for which a small central depression is created with a thumb or small spoon before baking to contain a filling, such as jam or a chocolate chip. In the UK, the term \"cookie\" often refers only to this particular type of product.\nFilled cookies are made from a rolled cookie dough filled with a fruit, jam or confectionery filling before baking. Hamantashen are a filled cookie.\nMolded cookies are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. Snickerdoodles and peanut butter cookies are examples of molded cookies. Some cookies, such as hermits or biscotti, are molded into large flattened loaves that are later cut into smaller cookies.\nNo-bake cookies are made by mixing a filler, such as cereal or nuts, into a melted confectionery binder, shaping into cookies or bars, and allowing to cool or harden. Oatmeal clusters and rum balls are no-bake cookies.\nPressed cookies are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a cookie press into various decorative shapes before baking. Spritzgeb\u00e4ck is an example of a pressed cookie.\nRefrigerator cookies (also known as icebox cookies) are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to make the raw dough even stiffer before cutting and baking. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking. Pinwheel cookies and those made by Pillsbury are representative.\nRolled cookies are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Gingerbread men are an example.\nSandwich cookies are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a sandwich with a sweet filling. Fillings include marshmallow, jam, and icing. The Oreo cookie, made of two chocolate cookies with a vanilla icing filling, is an example.Other types of cookies are classified for other reasons, such as their ingredients, size, or intended time of serving:\n\nBreakfast cookies are typically larger, lower-sugar cookies filled with \"heart-healthy nuts and fiber-rich oats\" that are eaten as a quick breakfast snack.\nLow-fat cookies or diet cookies typically have lower fat than regular cookies.\nRaw cookie dough is served in some restaurants, though the eggs may be omitted since the dough is eaten raw, which could pose a salmonella risk if eggs were used. Cookie Dough Confections in New York City is a restaurant that has a range of raw cookie dough flavors, which are scooped into cups for customers like ice cream.\nSkillet cookies are big cookies that are cooked in a cast-iron skillet and served warm, while they are still soft and chewy. They are either eaten straight from the pan or cut into wedges, often with vanilla ice cream on top.\nSupersized cookies are large cookies such as the Panera Kitchen Sink Cookie. These very large cookies are sold at grocery stores, restaurants and coffeeshops.\nVegan cookies can be made with flour, sugar, nondairy milk and nondairy margarine. Aquafaba icing can be used to decorate the cookies.\nCookie cakes are made in a larger circular shape usually with writing made of frosting.\n\nReception\nLeah Ettman from Nutrition Action has criticized the high calorie count and fat content of supersized cookies, which are extra large cookies; she cites the Panera Kitchen Sink Cookie, a supersized chocolate chip cookie, which measures 5 1/2 inches in diameter and has 800 calories. For busy people who eat breakfast cookies in the morning, Kate Bratskeir from the Huffington Post recommends lower-sugar cookies filled with \"heart-healthy nuts and fiber-rich oats\". A book on nutrition by Paul Insel et al. notes that \"low-fat\" or \"diet cookies\" may have the same number of calories as regular cookies, due to added sugar.\n\nPopular culture\nThere are a number of slang usages of the term \"cookie\". The slang use of \"cookie\" to mean a person, \"especially an attractive woman\" is attested to in print since 1920. The catchphrase \"that's the way the cookie crumbles\", which means \"that's just the way things happen\" is attested to in print in 1955. Other slang terms include \"smart cookie\" and \"tough cookie.\" According to The Cambridge International Dictionary of Idioms, a smart cookie is \"someone who is clever and good at dealing with difficult situations.\" The word \"cookie\" has been vulgar slang for \"vagina\" in the US since 1970. The word \"cookies\" is used to refer to the contents of the stomach, often in reference to vomiting (e.g., \"pop your cookies\", a 1960s expression, or \"toss your cookies\", a 1970s expression). The expression \"cookie cutter\", in addition to referring literally to a culinary device used to cut rolled cookie dough into shapes, is also used metaphorically to refer to items or things \"having the same configuration or look as many others\" (e.g., a \"cookie cutter tract house\") or to label something as \"stereotyped or formulaic\" (e.g., an action movie filled with \"generic cookie cutter characters\").\n\"Cookie duster\" is a whimsical expression for a mustache.\nCookie Monster is a Muppet on the children's television show Sesame Street. He is best known for his voracious appetite for cookies and his famous eating phrases, such as \"Me want cookie!\", \"Me eat cookie!\" (or simply \"COOKIE!\"), and \"Om nom nom nom\" (said through a mouth full of food).Cookie Clicker is a game where you click a cookie.\n\nNotable varieties\nGallery\nRelated pastries and confections\nManufacturers\nProduct lines and brands\nMiscellaneous\nSee also\nList of baked goods\nList of cookies\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\nList of desserts\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCumo, C.

        "body": "Porcupine meatballs are an American casserole dish of ground beef and rice meatballs cooked in tomato sauce. They were a staple during the Great Depression requiring only a few basic ingredients: ground beef, uncooked long-grain rice, onion, and canned tomato soup. The name comes from the appearance of the meatballs, which appear prickly when the rice pokes out of them as they cook, resembling a porcupine.Porcupine meatballs can be made in the slow cooker or baked. They can be served with relish such as red cabbage or radish and mashed potatoes. Leftovers can be made into sandwiches.\n\nHistory\nTo make the dish the rice meatballs were pan-seared and slowly simmered in canned tomato soup. The dish continued to be popular into the 1970s. The recipe appears as \"rice meat balls\" in the 1918 cookbook \"Conservation Recipes\".Other ingredients could be added to the meatballs like green pepper, mustard, celery, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, or other seasonings. The simple tomato sauce made with canned soup could be enriched with molasses and seasoned with chili powder and cumin. A later recipe from 1969 for \"Porcupine meatballs paprika\" replaces tomato soup with cream of mushroom, and adds other ingredients like mustard, or sour cream and paprika. \"Porcupine meatballs Chinois\" was a variation influenced by Chinese cooking techniques and ingredients. Served with peach sauce, the Chinois meatballs are made with ground pork, shrimp, rice and green onion, seasoned with soy sauce and sherry, and steamed instead of being cooked in sauce.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFoods and Nutrition:Ground Beef, Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, August 1980",

        "body": "Rappie pie is a traditional Acadian dish from southwest Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and areas of Prince Edward Island. It is sometimes referred to as rapure pie, r\u00e2p\u00e9e, or r\u00e2pure. Its name is derived from the French patates r\u00e2p\u00e9es meaning 'grated potatoes'. It is a casserole-like dish formed by grating potatoes, then squeezing them through cheesecloth to remove some of the water from the potato solids. The removed liquid is replaced by adding hot broth made from chicken, pork or seafood along with meat and onions, and layering additional grated potatoes over the top.\nCommon meat fillings include beef, chicken, or bar clams.\n\nHistory\nIt is thought that rappie pie has its origins in the Acadian Expulsion, among Acadians who lived out their exile in Massachusetts. This opportunity to meet and interact with other immigrant groups would naturally encourage a sharing of cultural recipes. It may have been German or Swiss immigrants who taught the Acadians their technique for using grated potatoes in their recipes, but whoever it was, this proved to be an important tip for those that returned to Nova Scotia and the Maritimes when the expulsion was lifted. When they returned, they found that their fertile land had been given to Loyalist New Englanders lured north by the promise of farmland. The harsh, rocky land that remained was excellent for growing potatoes, if little else, so the Acadians used them to fill out dishes made with what game was available.\n\nSee also\nGratin, the French cuisine cooking technique\nR\u00f6sti, the national Swiss dish of shredded potatoes\nHotdish, the Northern Midwestern American casserole\nList of casserole dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Tetrazzini is an Italian-American dish made with diced poultry or seafood and in a butter, cream or milk and cheese sauce flavored with sherry or white wine, and combined with linguine, spaghetti, egg noodles, or other types of pasta, sometimes topped with breadcrumbs or cheese, and garnished with parsley or basil.The dish is named after the Italian opera star Luisa Tetrazzini. The origins of tetrazzini are widely disputed. Some accounts ascribe tetrazzini as a creation of Auguste Escoffier. Other sources claim tetrazzini to be invented in the early 1900s by Ernest Arbogast, the chef at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California, where Luisa Tetrazzini made her American debut at the Tivoli as Gilda in Rigoletto on January 11, 1905. However, other sources attribute the origin to the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City.In 1950s through the 1980s, upscale New York City restaurants including Mamma Leone's and Sardi's featured tetrazzini on the menu. The Sardi's tetrazzini recipe was featured in Vincent Price's cookbook A Treasury of Great Recipes, and mentioned in the Sue Kaufman novel Diary of a Mad Housewife. Tetrazzini frozen dinners were popular in the 1960s, as noted by Joan Didion in The Saturday Evening Post article \"The Big Rock Candy Figgy Pudding Pitfall\". Recipes for tetrazzini, both from-scratch and using convenience ingredients, were popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and the dish was featured in an episode of Mad Men. The Unofficial Mad Men Cookbook, a collection of vintage recipes featuring dishes featured in the run of the show. The cookbook included recipes drawn from various popular mid-century restaurants and cookbooks, including a recipe for tetrazzini originally published in Betty Crocker's Hostess Cookbook. In the 1960s, southern restaurants and Junior League cookbooks began featuring versions of tetrazzini (often referred to as chicken spaghetti throughout the south). In the 1960s, the famed Piccadilly Cafeteria in Baton Rouge introduced chicken tetrazzini to the menu, and it remains a customer favorite decades later. Foster's Market in Durham, North Carolina, introduced chicken spaghetti to their in-house dining and catering menus in the 1980s, with their version based upon the chicken spaghetti recipe featured in the Baton Rouge Junior League cookbook River Road Recipes. In the 1990s, tetrazzini and chicken spaghetti emerged as soul food classics.\n\nIn 21st century pop culture\nTetrazzini, specifically chicken tetrazzini, became an Internet meme after a woman on Maury accuses her friend of seducing her boyfriend by preparing his favorite meal, chicken tetrazzini. Clips from the episode were featured on the E! channel show, The Soup, in 2007. In 2020, Vice magazine food editor Farideh Sadeghin prepared chicken tetrazzini for their Munchies series, referencing the Maury episode as her inspiration for the dish.\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\nList of casserole dishes\nList of foods named after people\nList of foods of the Southern United States\nList of soul foods and dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

It is called by \"NaanaHatha\" (\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0bb9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbe) in Tamil language in East Tamil Nadu & \"Gnanakathaa\" ( \u0da4\u0dcf\u0dab\u0d9a\u0dad\u0dcf) in The Sinhala Language in Sri Lanka. In Afghanistan and Northeast Iran, these biscuits are called kulcha-e-khataye. Kulcha is a type of Afghan, Iranian and Indian bread similar to naan.\n\nHistory\nNankhatai is believed to have originated in Surat in the 16th century, when Dutch and Indians were the important spice traders. A Dutch couple set up a bakery in Surat to meet the needs of local Dutch residents. When the Dutch left India, they handed over the bakery to an Iranian. The bakery biscuits were disliked by the locals. To save his business he started selling dried bread at low prices. It became so popular that he started drying the bread before selling it. With time, his experimentation with bread inspired him to ultimately invent nankhatai. The main ingredients in nankhatai are refined flour, chickpea flour and semolina. Some other traditional nankhatai recipes do not use chickpea flour.\n\nSee also\nList of shortbread biscuits and cookies\nQurabiya\n\n\n== References ==",

The dish consists of a braised loin of veal, thinly sliced, filled with a thin layer of finely chopped mushrooms (duxelles) and onions (as soubise) between the slices, then reassembled in the original shape. It is then topped with Mornay sauce (bechamel sauce with cheese) and browned in the oven.Similar dishes are popular in Russia today where they usually go by the name French-style meat (Russian: \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u043f\u043e-\u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0438, tr. my\u00e1so po-frants\u00faski). In these varieties, veal is often replaced by cheaper sorts of meat, such as beef or pork, and the Mornay sauce may be replaced by mayonnaise.

        "body": "Boil up is a traditional M\u0101ori food from New Zealand.Boil-up traditionally is a broth/soup made from balanced combination of meat and bones (e.g. pork), with greens such as p\u016bh\u0101, watercress or cabbage, and k\u016bmara or potatoes, boiled together, along with flour dumplings known as \"doughboys\".\n\nOrigins\nIn Polynesian cuisine, food was boiled in wooden bowls into which a red-hot stone was dropped. This was sufficient for heating liquids and pastes, but was insufficient to cook taro or pork; those foods were usually baked in an earth oven. The M\u0101ori carried these traditions to Aotearoa (New Zealand), making puddings of grated k\u016bmara (called roroi) or mashed kiekie flower bracts in large wooden bowls.When European settlers arrived they brought with them new foods and iron cooking pots. Pigs and potatoes from Europe were rapidly adopted by M\u0101ori, who produced large quantities for trading with the settlers. As settler housing did not have the built-in coal ranges and ovens of Regency Britain, most cooking was done on a hearth, in a cast-iron three-legged cauldron or camp oven. Camp ovens were imported in their hundreds from the 1850s, and were popular with M\u0101ori: they could be transported by waka or carried, and could stand on three feet in the embers or be hung by a chain. Camp ovens were used for making flour-and-sugar puddings, baking traditional r\u0113wena bread, and for the first pork-and-potato boil ups.\n\n\n== References ==",

Homemade crab boil recipes call for abundant amounts of hot sauce, cayenne pepper, salt, bay leaf, lemon, and garlic. Mustard seeds, coriander seeds, and allspice are popular extra options. Many people will start with a commercial crab boil product and then supplement it with extra pepper. The leading commercial product is Zatarain's which comes in two forms. One is a mesh bag with seasonings inside that will steep into the water. The second is a liquid concentrate that can be added directly to the water. The concentrate form can also be used as a flavor enhancer for soups.  Other regional crab boil companies are Tony Chachere's, and Rex Crab Boil. Note that even when boiling shrimp or crawfish, most recipes call for adding crab boil packets as a seasoning.\n\nCarolinas\nThe Lowcountry boil, Tidewater boil, and Frogmore Stew are variations on the same theme in North and South Carolina.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSC Beaufort Stew\nLouisiana Crab boil\nZatarain's Crab boil\nRex's Home Page\nMild Carolina boil\nSpicy Carolina boil",

        "body": "Boiled dressing is a type of creamy salad dressing of English and German origin that was especially popular in the 19th century and early 20th century as an alternative to mayonnaise, which is of French origin.  Boiled dressing is easier for less skilled cooks to make from scratch, and liquid food oils needed to make mayonnaise were not readily available in Northern Europe and the United States in the 19th century. Mayonnaise was not available for retail purchase until 1912.\n\nPreparation\nThere are many variations of boiled dressing, and common ingredients include vinegar, sugar or honey, milk or cream, eggs or egg yolks, salt, mustard, cayenne and flour. Sometimes, the dressing is actually boiled but more often, it is gently cooked over boiling water in a double boiler. It was used in salads like cole slaw, chicken salad, potato salad and egg salad.\n\nTypes\nSalad cream, a product popular in the United Kingdom, is a type of boiled dressing developed by Heinz in 1914. Miracle Whip is a variant of boiled dressing popular in the United States since 1933, marketed by Kraft Foods, Inc. as a product that \"combines the best qualities of fine mayonnaise and good old-fashioned boiled dressing by a secret recipe\".\n\nHistory\nA 1915 presentation of an elaborate Christmas dinner published in the New York Times was created by a home economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The article included a recipe for a boiled dressing recommended for use in chicken salad or fruit salad.Culinary writer M.F.K. Fisher preferred mayonnaise  to boiled dressing, because she associated boiled dressing with her grandmother's old fashioned insistence on using it on lettuce. Another food writer, James Beard, loved cole slaw made with boiled dressing, because of pleasant childhood memories of the dish made by his family's beloved Chinese cook, Jue-Let, who was a major culinary influence on Beard.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A hot tamale is a traditional dish native to the Mississippi Delta made of meat stuffed in cornmeal, wrapped in a corn husk, and simmered or boiled in a spiced brine. Hot tamales are smaller than the tamales found in Hispanic America and their recipes vary significantly from chef to chef. The most common meat is ground beef or pork, but some chefs use turkey or even venison if brought in by customers.\n\nHistory\nWhile the exact history of the hot tamale is unknown, there are several competing theories to explain its origin. One theory suggests that the meal dates back to the food prepared by Native Americans of the Mississippi delta. Another posits that it was brought back by soldiers returning from the Mexican-American War in the late 1840s. The final theory holds that the meal was created in the early 20th century when African Americans adapted the tamales prepared by Mexican migrant workers, which is believed by local historians to be the most likely origin.\n\nHot Tamale Trail\nThe \"Hot Tamale Trail\", a collection of restaurants and eateries that serve hot tamales, was created as a result of the documentation of the hot tamale by the Southern Foodways Alliance in the early 2000s. Local restaurants in Rosedale, Cleaveland, Greenville, and Vicksburg can be found along the trail. Greenville has so many restaurants serving hot tamales that they're the self-proclaimed \"Hot Tamale Capital of the world\" and hold the Hot Tamale Festival annually ever October.\n\nSee also\nGreenville, MS \u2013 Self-proclaimed \"Hot Tamale Capital of the World\".\n\"They're Red Hot\" \u2013 1936 song about Hot Tamales by Delta blues musician Robert Johnson.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSouthern Foodways Alliance \u2013 Hot Tamales Trail\nHot Tamales Trail map",

        "body": "Boiled peanuts are popular in some places where peanuts are common. Fully mature peanuts do not make good quality boiled peanuts; rather, raw or green ones are used.  Raw denotes peanuts in a semi-mature state, having achieved full size but not being fully dried, as would be needed for roasting or peanut butter use. Green denotes freshly harvested and undried peanuts that must be refrigerated. After boiling in salt water they take on a strong salty taste, becoming softer with prolonged cooking, and somewhat resembling a pea or bean, to which they are related because they are legumes and a nut only in the culinary sense.\nThe most flavorful peanuts for boiling are the Valencia type. These are preferred in the United States, being grown in gardens and small patches throughout the South. Green Virginia-type peanuts are also sometimes used.\n\nRegional variations\nSouthern United States\nBoiled peanuts are widely consumed and commercially available in an area of the Southern United States from North Carolina, south to central Florida, as far north as Ohio, and west to Mississippi.  The peanuts are sold in the hull and boiled with only salt or with a piquant spice mixture such as Old Bay or Zatarain's.  The latter are often called \"Cajun boiled peanuts\" in many recipes.\n\nHistory\nBoiling peanuts has been a folk cultural practice in the Southern United States, where they were originally called goober peas, since at least the 19th century.  The practice of eating boiled peanuts was likely brought by enslaved black people from West Africa, where the related bambara groundnut is a traditional staple crop.:\u200a64\u200a In July and August, when the peanut crops would come in, unsold and surplus peanuts would be prepared in a boiling pot, and extended families and neighbors would gather to share conversation and food.  Like a fish fry, peanut boils have been organizing principles for social gatherings. Like okra, fried green tomatoes, black-eyed peas, collard greens and pork barbecue, boiled peanuts are symbols of Southern culture and cuisine.\nThe first recipe for boiled peanuts was published by Almeda Lambert in 1899.:\u200a64\u200a  Boiled peanuts became a mainstream commodity in the lower South in the early 20th century.:\u200a64\u200a  A 1925 account from Orangeburg, South Carolina (where author Andrew F. Smith believes the sale of boiled peanuts may have begun), mentions boys hawking the food as a snack for five cents per bag.:\u200a64\u200a  The snack was also canned for consumption out of season.:\u200a64\n\nPreparation\nRaw peanuts and green peanuts are generally used for boiled peanuts. A green peanut is a farm-fresh harvested peanut that has not been dehydrated. They are available from grocery stores, food distributors and farmers markets during the growing season. \"Raw\" peanuts are also uncooked but have been dried/dehydrated and must be rehydrated before boiling (usually in a bowl full of water overnight). Once rehydrated, the raw peanuts are ready to be boiled.Raw peanuts in the shell are put in a large pot of very heavily salted water and boiled. This can be done inside on a stove, or outside on a propane burner or fire pit for a larger volume. Depending on the locality, some cooks use rock salt or standard table salt, or both. The boil can go on from four to seven hours or more, depending on quantity and the age of the peanut (green peanuts cook faster and tend to be better tasting), and the boilings will most often be of several gallons of water. Flavorings such as ham hocks, hot sauce, Cajun seasonings or beer can be added to the boil. An alternative method for dried raw mature peanuts is to rehydrate them by soaking overnight in water, after which they can be cooked in the conventional manner.\nThe resulting snack is a very soft peanut in the shell, invariably quite salty. The softened peanuts are easy to open. Often small, immature peanuts (called \"pops\") are included; these have even softer shells and can be eaten in their entirety. They tend to absorb more salt than the larger ones. Some aficionados of the dish prefer them cooked for a shorter period of time so that the nut is not as soft.\nBoiled peanuts can become slimy or moldy quite quickly without refrigeration. Boiled peanuts can be frozen, then later reheated in a microwave or boiling water for out-of-season consumption. Properly frozen, the flavor is well maintained for even several years.\nBoiled peanuts can also be canned and are available commercially.\n\nCultural importance\nOn May 1, 2006, Governor Mark Sanford signed a bill, H.4585, making boiled peanuts the official snack food of South Carolina.\n\nAfrica\nIn Ghana and Nigeria, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food. They are also popular in the KwaZulu Natal region of South Africa, especially in Durban.\nHistorically, the Bambara groundnut was eaten boiled much like a boiled peanut in much of Africa.:\u200a8\u200a  Following the introduction of peanuts to Africa in the 16th century, they largely displaced the Bambara groundnut in cuisine.:\u200a9\n\nAsia\nIn China, peanuts are generally boiled with a little salt, sometimes with star anise.Boiled peanuts in Taiwan are called t\u01d4d\u00f2u (\u571f\u8c46), although this also refers to peanuts boiled without the hulls such as those in peanut soup (t\u01d4d\u00f2u tang \u571f\u8c46\u6e6f).  Boiled peanuts were traditionally sold in Taiwan by itinerant hawkers (rather than in fixed markets) or prepared in homes by boiling the peanuts in woks.  With itinerant hawkers increasingly rare in the country, boiled peanuts in the shell are now seldom consumed.\nIn Vietnam, boiled peanuts are called \u0111\u1eadu ph\u1ecdng lu\u1ed9c in the southern part of the country and l\u1ea1c lu\u1ed9c in the northern part of Vietnam. They are often appreciated by eating them at informal gatherings of friends and family while drinking beer poured over ice.\nIn India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.\n\nCentral and South America\nBoiled peanuts have been eaten for centuries in South America.:\u200a64\u200a  In Salvador, Bahia, boiled peanuts are eaten as street food.Edward Long, in his 1774 History of Jamaica, notes the consumption of boiled peanuts on the island.:\u200a13\u200a  This practice was likely brought by the enslaved black people from Africa, where Long himself believed peanuts originated.:\u200a64,\u200a13\n\nPotential health benefits\nThe process of boiling peanuts draws antioxidants from their shells.  The boiled peanuts have four times the antioxidants of raw or roasted peanuts. Boiled peanuts have also been studied as a potential way to treat people with peanut allergies since boiling peanuts denatures proteins that trigger allergic reactions.  In one study, boiled peanuts were given in increasing amounts to four patients over time.  Some but not all patients were able to start eating raw peanuts.\n\nSee also\nList of peanut dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAbout the US Peanut Industry\nCommercial green peanut production (for boiled peanuts)\nGrowing peanuts in the garden (for boiled peanuts)\nSeriously Asian: Chinese Boiled Peanuts with photos of Chinese boiled peanuts\n\u6f8e\u6e56\u7f8e\u98df Penghu Cuisine photos of Taiwanese boiled peanuts (in Chinese)",

In general, aborrajado means a dish of cheese-filled plantains dipped in batter and deep-fried (giving it its name, which means \"battered\"), but the term can be used for other variations of the dish like Aborrajado con Chicharr\u00f3n, which includes chicharr\u00f3n (fried pork belly), in addition to the basic recipe of plantains and cheese.

        "body": "Sushi (\u3059\u3057, \u5bff\u53f8, \u9ba8, \u9b93, pronounced [s\u026f\u0255i\ua71c] or [s\u026f\ua71c\u0255i] ) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (\u9ba8\u98ef, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,  plus a variety of ingredients (\u306d\u305f, neta), such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked). Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is \"sushi rice\", also referred to as shari (\u3057\u3083\u308a), or sumeshi (\u9162\u98ef).The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603\u20131867). It was the fast food of the ch\u014dnin class in the Edo period.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.\nSushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, without sushi rice.\n\nHistory\nNarezushi\nA dish known as narezushi (\u99b4\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \u719f\u5bff\u53f8, \"matured fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. Narezushi is also called honnare, meaning \"fully fermented,\" as opposed to namanare, meaning \"partially fermented\", a type of sushi that appeared in the Muromachi period.Fermented fish using rice, such as Narezushi, originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve freshwater fish, possibly in the Mekong River basin, which is now Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, and in the Irrawaddy River basin, which is now Myanmar. The first mention of a narezushi-like food is in a Chinese dictionary thought to be from the 4th Century, in this instance referring to salted fish that had been placed in cooked or steamed rice, which caused it to undergo a fermentation process via lactic acid. Fermentation methods following similar logic in other Asian rice cultures include burong isda, balao-balao, and tinapayan of the Philippines; pekasam of Indonesia and Malaysia, pla ra (\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32) of Thailand; and sikhae (\uc2dd\ud574) of Korea.The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season, and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the following months, and narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means \"sour-tasting\", as the overall dish has a sour and umami or savory taste. The term comes from an antiquated \u3057 shi terminal-form conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui (\u9178\u3044, \"to be sour\"), resulting in the term sushi (\u9178\u3057). Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.In the Y\u014dr\u014d Code (\u990a\u8001\u5f8b\u4ee4, Y\u014dr\u014d-ritsury\u014d) of 718, the characters for \"\u9ba8\" and \"\u9b93\" are written as a tribute to the Japanese imperial court, and although there are various theories as to what exactly this food was, it is possible that it referred to narezushi.\n\nNamanare\nUntil the early 19th century sushi slowly changed and the Japanese cuisine changed as well. The Japanese started eating three meals a day, rice was boiled instead of steamed, and of large importance was the development of rice vinegar.During the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573), the Japanese invented a style of sushi called namanare or namanari (\u751f\u6210\u3001\u306a\u307e\u306a\u308c\u3001\u306a\u307e\u306a\u308a), which means \"partially fermented\". The fermentation period of namanare was shorter than that of the earlier narezushi, and the rice used for fermentation was also eaten with the fish. In other words, with the invention of namanare, sushi changed from a preserved fish food to a food where fish and rice are eaten together. After the appearance of namanare, sake and sake lees were used to shorten fermentation, and vinegar was used in the Edo period.\n\nHayazushi\nDuring the Edo period (1603\u20131867), a third type of sushi, haya-zushi (\u65e9\u5bff\u53f8\u3001\u65e9\u305a\u3057, \"fast sushi\"), was developed. Haya-zushi differed from earlier sushi in that instead of lactic fermentation of rice, vinegar, a fermented food, was mixed with rice to give it a sour taste so that it could be eaten at the same time as the fish. Previously, sushi had evolved with a focus on shortening the fermentation period, but with the invention of haya-zushi, which is simply mixed with vinegar, the fermentation process was eliminated and sushi became a fast food. Many types of sushi known in the world today, such as chirashizushi (\u6563\u3089\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"scattered sushi\"), inarizushi (\u7a32\u8377\u5bff\u53f8, \"Inari sushi\"), makizushi (\u5dfb\u5bff\u53f8, \"rolled sushi\"), and nigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\"), were invented during this period, and they are a type of haya-zushi. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations. A 1689 cookbook describes haya-zushi, and a 1728 cookbook describes pouring vinegar over hako-zushi (\u7bb1\u305a\u3057, \"box sushi\") (square sushi made by filling a wooden frame with rice).\n\nNigirizushi\nToday's style of nigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\"), consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it, became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of the origin of nigirizushi origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799\u20131858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ry\u014dgoku. The nigirizushi of this period was somewhat different from modern nigirizushi. The sushi rice of this period was about three times the size of today's nigirizushi. The amount of vinegar used was half that of today's sushi, and the type of vinegar developed during this period, called aka-su (\u8d64\u9162, \"red vinegar\"), was made by fermenting sake lees. They also used slightly more salt than in modern times instead of sugar. Seafood served over rice was prepared in a variety of ways. This red vinegar was developed by Nakano Matazaemon (\u4e2d\u91ce \u53c8\u4f50\u885b\u9580), who is the founder of Mizkan, a company that still develops and sells vinegar and other seasonings today.The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.\n\nConveyor belt sushi\nIn 1958, Yoshiaki Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant (\u56de\u8ee2\u5bff\u53f8, kaiten-zushi) named \"Genroku Zushi\" in Higashi-Osaka. In conveyor belt sushi restaurants, conveyor belts installed along tables and counters in the restaurant transport plates of sushi to customers. Generally, the bill is based on the number of plates, with different colored plates representing the price of the sushi.When Genroku Sushi opened a restaurant at the Japan World Exposition, Osaka, 1970, it won an award at the expo, and conveyor belt sushi restaurants became known throughout Japan. In 1973, an automatic tea dispenser was developed, which is now used in conveyor belt sushi restaurants today. When the patent for conveyor belt sushi restaurants expired, a chain of conveyor belt sushi restaurants was established, spreading conveyor belt sushi throughout Japan and further popularizing and lowering the price of sushi. By 2021, the conveyor belt sushi market had grown to 700 billion yen and spread outside Japan.\n\nSushi in English\nThe earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\". There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese\u2013English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.\n\nTypes\nThe common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is pronounced with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi.\n\nChirashizushi\nChirashizushi (\u3061\u3089\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as barazushi) serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is popular because it is filling, fast, and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March and Kodomonohi in May.\n\nEdomae chirashizushi (Edo-style scattered sushi) is served with uncooked ingredients in an artful arrangement.\nGomokuzushi (Kansai-style sushi) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice.\nSake-zushi (Kyushu-style sushi) uses rice wine over vinegar in preparing the rice and is topped with shrimp, sea bream, octopus, shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and shredded omelette.\n\nInarizushi\nInarizushi (\u7a32\u8377\u5bff\u53f8) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone. According to Shinto lore, inarizushi is named after the god Inari. Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an inarizushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (\u5e1b\u7d17\u5bff\u53f8, fukusa-zushi, or \u8336\u5dfe\u5bff\u53f8, chakin-zushi) instead of tofu. It should not be confused with inari maki, a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.\nCone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, gobo, or poke along with rice, wrapped in a triangular abura-age piece. It is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.\n\nMakizushi\nMakizushi (\u5dfb\u304d\u5bff\u53f8, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (\u6d77\u82d4\u5dfb\u304d, \"nori roll\", used generically for other dishes as well) or makimono (\u5dfb\u7269, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece formed with the help of a mat known as a makisu (\u5dfb\u304d\u7c3e). Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed) but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is often cut into six or eight pieces, constituting a single roll order. Short-grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice.\nNowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice, and cereals. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating.\nBelow are some common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist.\n\nFutomaki (\u592a\u5dfb, \"thick, large, or fat rolls\") is a large, cylindrical style of sushi, usually with nori on the outside. A typical futomaki is five to six centimeters (2 to 2+1\u20442 in) in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may use strips of cucumber, kampy\u014d gourd, takenoko (bamboo shoots), or lotus root. Strips of tamagoyaki omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and oboro whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Traditionally, the vinegared rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sugar. Popular proteins are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, egg, tuna, or shrimp. Vegetables usually include cucumber, lettuce, and takuan (\u6ca2\u5eb5, pickled radish).\nTamago makizushi (\u7389\u5b50\u5dfb\u304d\u5bff\u53f8) is makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg.\nTempura makizushi (\u5929\u3077\u3089 \u5dfb\u304d\u5bff\u53f8) or agezushi (\u63da\u3052\u5bff\u53f8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb) is a fried version of the dish.\nDuring the evening of the festival of Setsubun (\u7bc0\u5206), it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat a particular kind of futomaki in its uncut cylindrical form, called eh\u014dmaki (\u60e0\u65b9\u5dfb, \"lucky direction roll\"). By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan. Eh\u014dmaki is a roll composed of seven ingredients considered to be lucky. The typical ingredients include kanpy\u014d, egg, eel, and shiitake. Eh\u014dmaki often include other ingredients too. People usually eat the eh\u014dmaki while facing the direction considered to be auspicious that year.\nHosomaki (\u7d30\u5dfb, \"thin rolls\") is a type of small cylindrical sushi with nori on the outside. A typical hosomaki has a diameter of about 2.5 centimeters (1 in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, kanpy\u014d, natt\u014d, umeboshi paste, and squid with shiso (Japanese herb).\nKappamaki (\u6cb3\u7ae5\u5dfb) is a kind of hosomaki filled with cucumber. It is named after the Japanese legendary water imp, fond of cucumbers, called the kappa. Traditionally, kappamaki is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods.\nTekkamaki (\u9244\u706b\u5dfb) is a kind of hosomaki filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word tekka, meaning \"red hot iron\", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called tekkaba (\u9244\u706b\u5834), much like the origins of the sandwich.\nNegitoromaki (\u306d\u304e\u3068\u308d\u5dfb) is a kind of hosomaki filled with negitoro, also known as scallion (negi) and chopped tuna (toro). Fatty tuna is often used in this style.\nTsunamayomaki (\u30c4\u30ca\u30de\u30e8\u5dfb) is a kind of hosomaki filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.\nTemaki (\u624b\u5dfb, \"hand roll\") is a large cone-shaped style of sushi with nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki is about 10 centimeters (4 in) long and is eaten with the fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, temaki must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the nori in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film, which is removed immediately before eating.\n\nModern narezushi\nNarezushi (\u719f\u308c\u5bff\u53f8, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more.The most famous variety of narezushi are the ones offered as a specialty dish of Shiga Prefecture, particularly the funa-zushi made from fish of the crucian carp genus, the authentic version of which calls for the use of nigorobuna, a particular locally differentiated variety of wild goldfish endemic to Lake Biwa.\n\nNigirizushi\nNigirizushi (\u63e1\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that a chef typically presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball and a topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi; toppings are typically fish such as salmon, tuna, or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago).\nGunkanmaki (\u8ecd\u8266\u5dfb, \"warship roll\") is a special type of nigirizushi: an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of nori wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of nori such as roe, natt\u014d, oysters, uni (sea urchin roe), sweetcorn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. Gunkan-maki was invented at the Ginza Kyubey restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.Temarizushi (\u624b\u307e\u308a\u5bff\u53f8, \"ball sushi\") is a style of sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.\n\nOshizushi\nOshizushi (\u62bc\u3057\u5bff\u53f8, \"pressed sushi\"), also known as hako-zushi (\u7bb1\u5bff\u53f8, \"box sushi\"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the mold's lid to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is battera (\u30d0\u30c3\u30c6\u30e9, pressed mackerel sushi) or saba zushi (\u9bd6\u5bff\u53f8). In oshizushi, all the ingredients are either cooked or cured, and raw fish is never used.Oshizushi wrapped in persimmon leaves, a specialty of Nara, is known as kakinohazushi (\u67ff\u306e\u8449\u5bff\u53f8).\n\nWestern-style sushi\nThe increasing popularity of sushi worldwide has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. The Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains parasites and must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible. On the other side of the world, in the 1960s and 1970s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with aquaculture farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being farm-raised, the Atlantic salmon reportedly showed advantages over the Pacific salmon, such as no parasites, easy animal capture, and could be grown with higher fat content. With government subsidies and improved techniques, they were so successful in raising fatty and parasite-free salmon they ended up with a surplus. Norway has a small population and limited market; therefore, they looked to other countries to export their salmon. The first Norwegian salmon was imported into Japan in 1980, accepted conventionally, for grilling, not for sushi. Salmon had already been consumed in North America as an ingredient in sushi as early as the 1970s. Salmon sushi did not become widely accepted in Japan until a successful marketing partnership in the late 1980s between Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry glut, and the Japanese food supplier Nichirei.Other sushi creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll, a norimaki which presently almost always uses imitation crab (the original recipe calls for real cooked crab), along with avocado and cucumber. A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) have evolved since. 'Norway roll' is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.\n\nUramaki\nUramaki (\u88cf\u5dfb, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical style of sushi with two or more fillings and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. Uramaki differs from other makimono because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside. The filling is surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber, or carrots.\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\nIn Japan, uramaki is an uncommon type of makimono; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.In Brazil uramaki and other sushi pieces commonly include cream cheese in their recipe. Although unheard of in Japanese sushi, this is the most common sushi ingredient used in Brazil. Temaki also often contains a large amount of cream cheese and is extremely popular in restaurants.\n\nAmerican-style makizushi\nMultiple-filling rolls inspired by futomaki are a more popular type of sushi within the United States and come in variations that take their names from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the tempura roll, where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, known as forbidden rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.\nPer Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen before serving to kill parasites.Since rolls are often made to order, it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g., salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include the following:\n\nCanada\nMany of the styles seen in the United States are also seen in Canada and their own. Doshi (a portmanteau of donut and sushi) is a donut-shaped rice ball on a deep-fried crab or imitation crab cake topped with sushi ingredients. Maki poutine is similar to makizushi in style except it is topped with cheese curds and gravy and contains duck confit, more cheese curds, and sweet potato tempura. Sushi cake is made of crab meat, avocado, shiitake mushroom, salmon, spicy tuna, and tobiko and served on sushi rice, then torched with spicy mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, and balsamic reduction, and dotted with caper and garlic chips. Sushi pizza is deep-fried rice or crab/imitation crab cake topped with mayonnaise and various sushi ingredients.\n\nMexico and the Western United States\nSinaloan sushi originated in Sinaloa, Mexico and has been available in the Western United States since 2013.\n\nSimilar dishes in Asia\nSouth Korea\nGimbap, similar to makizushi, is an internationally popular convenience food of Korean origin. It consists of gim (the Korean version of nori) rolled around rice seasoned with sesame oil, instead of vinegar, and a variety of ingredients such as vegetables, like danmuji, and meat, like bulgogi.\n\nIngredients\nAll sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients. Traditional Japanese sushi consists of rice flavored with vinegar sauce and various raw or cooked ingredients.\n\nSushi-meshi\nSushi-meshi (\u9ba8\u98ef) (also known as su-meshi (\u9162\u98ef), shari (\u820e\u5229), or gohan (\u3054\u98ef)) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It must be cooled to room temperature before being used for a sushi filling, or it will get too sticky while seasoned. Traditionally, it is mixed with a hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel) and a shamoji (a wooden paddle).\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi differs from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice, and individual chefs have their methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kant\u014d region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\nNori\nThe dark green seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori (\u6d77\u82d4). Nori is a type of algae traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\nThe size of a nori sheet influences the size of makimono. A full-size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately-sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet.\nNori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\nWhen making fukusazushi, a paper-thin omelet may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelet is traditionally made on a rectangular omelet pan, known as a makiyakinabe, and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.\n\nGu\nThe ingredients used inside sushi are called gu and are, typically, varieties of fish. For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in a commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of \u014dtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and ch\u016btoro, meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi, where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw toppings, called neta.Other seafoods such as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp (ebi and amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagai), fish roe (ikura, masago, kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni), crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters are less common, as the taste is thought to not go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.Pickled daikon radish (takuan) in shinko maki, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), fermented soybeans (natt\u014d) in natt\u014d maki, avocado, cucumber in kappa maki, asparagus, yam, pickled ume (umeboshi), gourd (kanpy\u014d), burdock (gobo), and sweet corn (sometimes mixed with mayonnaise) are plant products used in sushi.\nTofu, eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki), and raw quail eggs (as a gunkan-maki topping) are also common.\n\nCondiments\nSushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in sh\u014dyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork, and other sushi cuts.\nThe traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish, mustard powder, and green dye, is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi, and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\". The spicy compound in both true and imitation wasabi is allyl isothiocyanate, which has well-known anti-microbial properties. However, true wasabi may contain some other antimicrobials as well.Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari.\nSushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly-sliced vegetables, carrots, radishes, and cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (\u5207\u308a\u7b39). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (\u8449\u862d, haran) and Sasa veitchii (\u718a\u7b39, kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut, thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi.Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration, which extended sushi's shelf life without the need for cut leaves. Today plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and, to a lesser degree, in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.\n\nNutrition\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped in sushi may also offer nutrients.\n\nHealth risks\nPotential chemical and biological hazards in sushi include environmental contaminants, pathogens, and toxins.\nLarge marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, one of many toxins of marine pollution. Frequent or significantly large consumption of methylmercury can lead to developmental defects when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children. A 2021 study in Catalonia, Spain reported that the estimated exposure to methylmercury in sushi consumption by adolescents exceeded the tolerable daily intake.A 2011 article reported approximately 18 million people infected with fish-borne flukes worldwide. Such an infection can be dangerous for expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. These illnesses' impact can pose health concerns for the expecting mother and baby.Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nClonorchis sinensis, a fluke which can cause clonorchiasis\nAnisakis, a roundworm which can cause anisakiasis\nDiphyllobothrium, a tapeworm which can cause diphyllobothriasisFor these reasons, EU regulations forbid using raw fish that had not previously been frozen. It must be frozen at temperatures below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) in all product parts for no less than 24 hours. Fish for sushi may be flash frozen on fishing boats and by suppliers to temperatures as low as \u221260 \u00b0C (\u221276 \u00b0F). Super-freezing destroys parasites, and also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh that causes discoloration at temperatures above \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F).Calls for stricter analysis and regulation of seafood include improved product description. A 2021 DNA study in Italy found 30%\u201340% of fish species in sushi incorrectly described.Some forms of sushi, notably those containing the fugu pufferfish and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Fugu consumption, in particular, can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. Licensing involves a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs; only about 35 percent of applicants pass.\n\nSustainable sushi\nSustainable sushi is made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired.\n\nPresentation\nTraditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, keeping with this cuisine's aesthetic qualities.Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \u677e\u7af9\u6885 (sh\u014d-chiku-bai), sh\u014d/matsu (\u677e, pine), chiku/take (\u7af9, bamboo), and bai/ume (\u6885, plum), with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.\n\nSushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) style: color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt from which diners pick as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.There is a practice called nyotaimori which entails serving sushi on the naked body of a woman.\n\nGlossary\nSome specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars.\n\nAgari: lit.\u2009'Rise up', refers to green tea. Ocha (\u304a\u8336) in usual Japanese.\nGari: Sweet, pickled and sliced ginger, or sushi ginger. Sh\u014dga (\u751f\u59dc) in standard Japanese.\nGyoku: \"Jewel\". Sweet, cube-shaped omelette. \u5375\u713c, \u7389\u5b50\u713c (Tamagoyaki) in standard Japanese.\nMurasaki: \"Violet\" or \"purple\" (color). Soy sauce. Sh\u014dyu (\u91a4\u6cb9) in standard Japanese.\nNeta: Toppings on nigiri or fillings in makimono. A reversal of the standard Japanese tane (\u7a2e).\nOaiso: \"Compliment\". Bill or check. Oaiso may be used in not only sushi bars but also izakaya. Okanj\u014d (\u304a\u52d8\u5b9a) or chekku (\u30c1\u30a7\u30c3\u30af) in standard Japanese.\nOtemoto: Chopsticks. Otemoto means the nearest thing to the customer seated. Hashi (\u7bb8) or ohashi in standard Japanese.\nSabi: Contracted form of wasabi (\u5c71\u8475), also known as Japanese horseradish.\nShari: Vinegar rice or rice. It may originally be from the Sanskrit zaali (\u0936\u093e\u0932\u093f) meaning rice, or \u015aar\u012bra. Gohan (\u3054\u98ef)) or meshi (\u98ef) in standard Japanese.\nTsume: Sweet thick sauce mainly made of soy sauce. Nitsume (\u716e\u8a70\u3081) in standard Japanese.\n\nEtiquette\nUnlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a bento, a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped to flavor it; the rice\u2014which has already been seasoned with rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt, mirin, and kombu\u2014would otherwise absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.Traditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and the diner should not add more. However, today, wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.\n\nUtensils used in making sushi\nGallery\nSee also\nGimbap, Korean variant of makizushi\nCustoms and etiquette in Japanese dining\nList of sushi and sashimi ingredients\nList of sushi restaurants\nNyotaimori, sushi presented on nude female body\nSashimi b\u014dch\u014d, Japanese knife to slice raw fish and seafood\nSpam musubi, Hawaiian variant of nigirizushi\nSushi machine\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nJoro Ono, Masuhiro Yamamoto (2014). \u9ba8 \u3059\u304d\u3084\u3070\u3057\u6b21\u90ce: JIRO GASTRONOMY (in Japanese).

        "body": "Almond chicken is an American Chinese dish. The most common variations involve either stir frying or deep frying chicken and topping it with almonds.\n\nPreparation\nSome variations of almond chicken are prepared in a similar manner to cashew chicken, by stir frying chicken with almonds and vegetables. This variation is found in the 1917 Chinese Cook Book by Shiu Wong Chan, which calls for stir frying chicken with onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts and celery before coating with \"Chinese gravy\" and topping with almonds. This is one of the oldest recipes for the dish.Other versions of the dish are prepared by battering chicken and coating it with almonds before frying.\n\nAlmond boneless chicken\nAlmond boneless chicken or War Sui Gai, a variation popular in Michigan, features sliced chicken which is deep fried twice. It is then topped with mushroom gravy and sliced almonds and served on a bed of iceberg lettuce. The dish is strongly associated with Detroit, but is also commonly served in Ohio and parts of Eastern Canada.The origins of almond boneless chicken are unknown, although it was likely developed by Chinese immigrants from Guangdong. It may have originated in Detroit, Michigan and was historically associated with chop suey houses.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Kompia or kompyang is a bread product that originates from Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province of China as well as Fuqing.  It is popular in Fujian and has spread to other areas including the Ryukyus, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia and the Malaysian towns of Sitiawan, Sibu, Ayer Tawar, Sarikei, Bintangor and other places where the dominant Chinese community is of Fuzhou (alternatively romanized as \"Foochow\") and Fuqing ancestry (where it is sometimes nicknamed \"Foochow bagels\").\n\nHistory\nKompia was named after Qi Jiguang, who invented it. When Qi Jiguang led his troops into Fujian in 1563, the Japanese pirates, fearing his name, engaged mainly in guerrilla-style battles. Qi Jiguang noticed that the Japanese pirates could always trace where his troops camped because of the smoke that rose up to the sky when the soldiers prepared their meals. He found out the Japanese pirates had no such problem because they brought onigiri with them. So Qi Jiguang invented a kind of bread with a hole in the center so that they could be strung together to be conveniently carried along. Later, to commemorate Qi Jiguang's victory against the pirate raiders, the bread was named after him as gu\u0101ng-b\u01d0ng (or \"Guang cake\").\n\nIngredients\nKompia is made with lard, onions, salt and flour. A ball of flour is stuffed with a filling of other desired ingredients and flattened with a rolling pin. It is then slapped onto the sides of a traditional home-made Chinese oven and takes approximately 15 minutes to bake.  Meat is often used as a filling in the bread.\n\nVariants\nA variant with sesame seeds scattered on top and baked without any filling is known as \u9ebb\u997c. A sweet variant known as \u5f81\u4e1c\u997c (literally \"Conquest of the East cake\") uses a proportion of sugar to substitute the salt in the dough.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Ch\u00e8 (Vietnamese pronunciation: [t\u0255\u025b\u0300]~[c\u025b\u0300]) is any traditional Vietnamese sweet beverage, dessert soup or stew, or pudding. Ch\u00e8 includes a wide variety of distinct soups or puddings. Varieties of Ch\u00e8 can be made with mung beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, tapioca, jelly (clear or grass), fruit (longan, mango, durian, lychee or jackfruit), and coconut cream. Other types are made with ingredients such as salt, aloe vera, seaweed, lotus seed, sesame seed, sugar palm seeds, taro, cassava and pandan leaf extract. Some varieties, such as ch\u00e8 tr\u00f4i n\u01b0\u1edbc, may also include dumplings. Ch\u00e8 are often prepared with one of a number of varieties of beans, tubers, and/or glutinous rice, cooked in water and sweetened with sugar. In southern Vietnam, ch\u00e8 are often garnished with coconut creme. \nCh\u00e8 may be served either hot or cold, and eaten with a bowl and spoon or drunk in a glass. Each variety of ch\u00e8 is designated by a descriptive word or phrase that follows the word ch\u00e8, such as ch\u00e8 \u0111\u1eadu \u0111\u1ecf (literally \"red bean ch\u00e8\").\nCh\u00e8 may be made at home, but are also commonly sold in plastic cups at Vietnamese grocery stores.\nIn northern Vietnam, ch\u00e8 is also the word for the tea plant.

        "body": "Bitterballen (plural of bitterbal) are a Dutch meat-based snack, made by making a very thick stew thickened with roux and beef stock and generously loaded with meat, refrigerating the stew until it firms, and then rolling the thick mixture into balls which then get breaded and fried. Seasonings in the base stew usually include onions, salt and pepper, parsley and nutmeg. Most recipes include nutmeg and there are also variations using curry powder or that add in finely chopped vegetables such as carrot.The bitterbal derives its name from a generic word for certain types of herb-flavoured alcoholic beverages, called a bitter in Dutch, and are popularly served as part of a bittergarnituur, a selection of savoury snacks to go with drinks, at pubs or at receptions in the Netherlands.Bitterballen are very similar to the more common croquette (kroketten in Dutch) in ingredients and preparation/cooking methods, as well as flavour, though the larger kroketten have a distinct oblong sausage shape, but with a similar diameter.\n\nPreparation\nThe ingredients are combined and cooked, then refrigerated for the mixture to firm up. Once firm, the filling is rolled into balls roughly 3 to 4 cm in diameter, then battered in a breadcrumb and egg mixture and deep-fried. They are typically served with a ramekin or small bowl of mustard for dipping. They are eaten in Suriname, the Netherlands Antilles, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bonaire, and to some degree in Indonesia.\n\nSee also\nList of meatball dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Dutch Table - Bitterballen",

The latter is also called makchang-gui (\ub9c9\ucc3d\uad6c\uc774; \"grilled last viscus\") or so-makchang-gui (\uc18c\ub9c9\ucc3d\uad6c\uc774; \"grilled beef last viscus\").

High calcium content and high catabolism for alcohol makes it a favorite anju (side dish for drinking).Makchang gui is said to have originated in Daegu and the surrounding Gyeongsang region. King Seonjo of Joseon is said to have enjoyed the dish at his inauguration.\n\nPreparation and serving\nMakchang is usually grilled over a barbecue, but preparation has to be done beforehand to rid the meat of odd odors and excessive fat. The meat may either be pre-boiled in water seasoned with doenjang, onions, medicinal herbs and such, or pre-marinated in a sauce made of various fruit (apple, Korean pear, pineapple, kiwi, etc.) before grilling.The dipping sauce is made from a mixture of doenjang, ground beans, ground red pepper, and chopped scallions. Fresh green and red peppers, cucumbers, minari and garlic are sometimes added according to personal taste.\n\nSee also\nKorean cuisine\nChitterlings\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMakchang photo\nMakchang photo",

Assorted fritters are called a-kyaw-sone (Burmese: \u1021\u1000\u103c\u1031\u102c\u103a\u1005\u102f\u1036). Burmese fritters are generally savory, and often use beans and pulses, similar to South Asian vada.\nThe fritters are eaten mainly at breakfast or as a snack at teatime, served at tea shops and hawker stands alike. They are typically served as standalone snacks dipped in a sour-sweet tamarind-based sauce, or as toppings for common Burmese dishes. Gourd, chickpea and onion fritters are cut into small parts and eaten with mohinga, Myanmar's national dish. These fritters are also eaten with kauk hnyin baung rice and with a Burmese green sauce called a-chin-yay (\u1021\u1001\u103b\u1009\u103a\u101b\u100a\u103a). Depending on the fritter hawker, the sauce is made from chili sauce diluted with vinegar, water, cilantro, finely diced tomatoes, garlic and onions.\n\nVariations\nDiced onions, chickpea, potatoes, a variety of leafy vegetables, brown bean paste, Burmese tofu, chayote, banana and crackling are other popular fritter ingredients.

The snack traditionally accompanies khow suey or atho, both of which are adaptations of Burmese noodle salad and ohn no khao sw\u00e8 respectively.

        "body": "The Bourbon (pronounced  or ) is a sandwich biscuit consisting of two thin rectangular dark chocolate-flavoured biscuits with a chocolate buttercream filling. \nThe biscuit was introduced in 1910 (originally under the name \"Creola\") by the biscuit company Peek Freans, of Bermondsey, London, originator of the Garibaldi biscuit. The Bourbon name, dating from the 1930s, comes from the former French and Spanish royal House of Bourbon. A 2009 survey found that the Bourbon biscuit was the fifth most popular biscuit in the United Kingdom for dunking into tea.The small holes in bourbon biscuits are to prevent the biscuits from cracking or breaking during the baking process, by allowing steam to escape.\nMany other companies make their own version of the biscuit under the \"Bourbon\" name, including major supermarkets.McVitie's chocolate-coated Penguin biscuits are made with the same biscuit mix as their bourbon biscuit, but the filling is different.\n\nEtymology\nIt is commonly believed that Peek Freans chose the name based on the French or Spanish House of Bourbon.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBBC News: The Link Between Bourbon Biscuits and Bourbon Whiskey",

        "body": "In Filipino cuisine, moron (also spelled mor\u00f3n or muron, the stress is placed on the last syllable) is a rice cake similar to suman. It is a native delicacy of the Waray people in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines, particularly in the area around Tacloban City in the province of Leyte and in Eastern Samar province. Other parts of the Philippines have their versions of it, however. In fact, the moron was adopted as one of Mambajao, Camiguin's locally produced products.Since it is a variety of suman, the moron is cooked with glutinous rice, coconut milk and sugar. The main difference is that moron is gyrated with chocolate tablea (tablets) or mixed with cocoa powder while a regular suman is not. It also has a hint of vanilla and is usually partnered with coffee or sikwate (a native Philippine chocolate drink). With chocolate as its distinct ingredient, it is also called chocolate moron or chocolate suman.\n\nPreparation\nThe common ingredients of moron consist of glutinous rice (locally known in Tagalog as malagkit and in the Eastern Visayas region as pilit), ordinary rice, coconut milk, sugar, chocolate or cocoa powder and melted butter. In preparation for cooking the malagkit and the ordinary rice, both rice types must be soaked together overnight and then ground the following day.  The ground rice is then soaked in coconut milk until it is soft, after which sugar and chocolate powder are added. The mixture is cooked over low fire while repeatedly stirred. When the consistency is thick, the cooked mixture is set aside for it to cool.After the mixture cools, banana leaves are prepared and cut to be used as wrappers.  The recommended amount is two tablespoons of the mixture per banana leaf. The moron is then brushed with butter.  After wrapping, both ends of the banana leaf are tied with string.  Lastly, the moron are steamed for about half an hour.  After the moron is cooled, it can now be served.\n\nConsumption\nMoron is usually sold in bundles of four pieces that are individually wrapped in a banana leaf. Tourists from Leyte usually buy moron as a pasalubong or gift for their relatives and friends.  In the places where moron originated, it is usually served at festivals, birthday parties, and funeral wakes.  Visitors from those parties usually take home some of the moron. The food is also a medium of exchange for goodwill in Tacloban and the nearby municipalities of Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Dulag, Mayorga and Abuyog.Philippine government agencies usually promote and support locally produced goods such as the moron.  The Department of Science and Technology of the Philippines advocated the longer shelf life of food products including the moron to help producers of those kind of food products while the Department of Trade and Industry of the Philippines conducted trade fairs to develop and promote products, which included the moron.  The Department of Labor and Employment of the Philippines meanwhile made a project in Mambujao, Camiguin for the production of moron.\n\nSee also\nBinagol\nMoron (psychology)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Chicken katsu (chicken cutlet (Japanese: \u30c1\u30ad\u30f3\u30ab\u30c4, Hepburn: chikinkatsu)), also known as panko chicken or tori katsu (torikatsu (\u9d8f\u30ab\u30c4)) is a Japanese dish of fried chicken made with panko bread crumbs. It is related to tonkatsu, fried pork cutlets. The dish has spread internationally and has become a common dish served at Japanese and East Asian restaurants worldwide.Like tonkatsu, chicken katsu is generally served with tonkatsu sauce (\u3068\u3093\u304b\u3064\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9), a thick Japanese vegetarian pureed fruit-based brown sauce with rice or miso soup as part of a two- or three-item set meal, or as dinner with rice and vegetables.\nIn Hawaii, chicken katsu is more popular than tonkatsu and substitutes for it in dishes such as katsukar\u0113 and katsudon. In a plate lunch, chicken katsu is generally served on a bed of shredded cabbage, with a well-seasoned ketchup similar to cocktail sauce.In the United Kingdom, the word \"katsu\" has become synonymous with Japanese curries as a whole, owing to the rapid rise in popularity of chicken katsu curry.\n\nEtymology\nKatsu (\u30ab\u30c4) is a shortened form of katsuretsu (\u30ab\u30c4\u30ec\u30c4), the Japanese transliteration of the English word \"cutlet\".\n\nSee also\nJapanese cuisine\nList of chicken dishes\nEscalope\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Chislic (or sometimes chislick) is a dish consisting of skewered cubes of red meat, usually mutton or lamb, although game meats such as venison and even beef steak can be used. \nMost commonly associated with the state of South Dakota, Belize, and Adam Thielen, chislic was declared the official state \"nosh\" of South Dakota in March 2018.\n\nEtymology\nThe word chislic is arguably derived from the Turkic word shashlik or shashlyk,  itself rooted in shish kebab, the Turkish term for skewered meats. Chislic may have been introduced into the United States by John Hoellwarth, who immigrated from the Crimea to Hutchinson County, South Dakota, in the 1870s.The dish may have been introduced to South Dakota by Hoellwarth, but is highly unlikely to have been the introduction to the US. Both Greek and Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire came to the US in the 17th,18th and 19th centuries, and even Martin the Armenian, a tobacco farmer in the original Jamestown colony.  They would have brought their common food preparation ideas with them.\n\nPreparation\nChislic consists of deep-fried cubes of mutton, lamb, beef or venison prepared rare to medium-rare, sprinkled with garlic salt or other seasoned salt, and served with toothpicks. The dish is typically served hot, accompanied by soda crackers. Regional variations exist: in Pierre, the meat is battered; in Sioux Falls, it is lightly dusted with flour before deep-frying and may be served with hot sauce; near Watertown, ranch dressing may be served on the side; while Lawry's Seasoned Salt is preferred near Redfield.\n\n\n== References ==",

Chugchucaras consists of deep fried pork, mote (boiled hominy), potatoes, fried plantains, empanadas, and pork rinds. It is accompanied by aji, a spicy sauce made with hot peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, and onions.Chugchucaras comes from two words in Kichwa (Ecuador's indigenous language): Chukchuna which means \"trembling\"; and Kara meaning \"pig skin\".This dish uses the different agricultural and animal products available in the area, as well as plantains that arrive from the lower tropical regions, since Latacunga is on trade routes between coastal, tropical areas and Quito.\nAlthough it is originally from Latacunga, this local delicacy can also be found in other cities of Ecuador.\n\nSee also\nList of Ecuadorian dishes and foods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Clam cakes (also known as clam fritters) are a part of New England cuisine, most commonly found in Rhode Island although they can also be found in Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts. They are balls of battered clams which have been deep-fried. On the Maine Coast, clam cakes are formed into large, flat patties and fried.  \nClam cakes are often served at take-out food outlets or other informal settings as finger food, as part of a meal consisting of several clam cakes, french fries, and cole slaw. This is often served alongside clam chowder. The cakes tend to be eaten dry, dipped in clam chowder, tartar sauce or ketchup.Clam fritters are particularly popular during clamming season when clams are in abundance and it is legal during limited, specified periods for private citizens to dig their own. The surplus of clams must be used up quickly so they do not spoil.Hank Shaw described them as, \"think clam beignet, or donut hole. Only savory. Crispy, golden brown on the outside, pillowy and light on the inside. Steam rises from the first bite. The slightest aroma of brine surrounds you. Tiny chunks of clam nestle themselves in the folds of the pillow, offering surprising bites of chewy meatiness as you down one of these little glories after another.\"\n\nPreparation\nEach clam cake is a deep-fried ball-shaped mixture containing chopped clam (usually quahog) combined with various other ingredients to give it a firm, hushpuppy-like consistency once fried. The batter is made from flour, milk, clam juice, eggs and a leavening agent, typically baking powder. Some recipes may include cornmeal.\n\nHistory\nLocal legend holds that clam cakes were first served at Aunt Carrie's, a seafood restaurant in Narragansett, Rhode Island in 1920. According to this legend, Carrie Cooper invented clam cakes by adding fresh clams to her corn fritter recipe, thus inventing clam fritters. Clam cake recipes are actually as old as the 19th century, and are an old staple of Rhode Island banking crisis cuisine.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nBethune, Meredith (August 17, 2016). \"Meet the Clam Cake\".

        "body": "Crispy fried chicken (simplified Chinese: \u70b8\u5b50\u9e21; traditional Chinese: \u70b8\u5b50\u96de) is a standard dish in the Cantonese cuisine of southern China and Hong Kong. The chicken is fried in such a way that the skin is extremely crunchy, but the white meat is relatively soft. This is done by first poaching the chicken in water with spices (e.g. star anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, Sichuan pepper, ginger, fennel, and scallions), drying it, coating with a syrup of vinegar and sugar, letting it dry thoroughly (which helps make the skin crispy) and deep-frying.The dish is often served with two side dishes, a pepper salt (\u6912\u9e7d) and prawn crackers (\u8766\u7247). The pepper salt, colored dark white to gray, is dry-fried separately in a wok. It is made of salt and Sichuan pepper.Traditionally this dish is eaten at night. It is also one of the traditional chicken dishes served at Chinese weddings and other Asian weddings.\n\nSee also\nChicken fingers\nChicken fries\nChicken nugget\nFried chicken\nKorean fried chicken\nList of chicken dishes\nWhite cut chicken\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Thai suki, known simply as suki (Thai: \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e01\u0e35\u0e49, pronounced [s\u016b.k\u00ee\u02d0]) in Thailand, is a Thai variant of hot pot, a communal dish where diners dip meat, seafood, noodles, dumplings and vegetables into a pot of broth cooking at the table and dip it into a spicy \"sukiyaki sauce\" before eating. Despite the name, the dish only barely resembles Japanese sukiyaki, having more in common with shabu shabu and Chinese hot pot.\nThai sukiyaki evolved from Chinese hot pot served in restaurants catering to members of Thailand's sizeable ethnic Chinese clientele, in which an aluminum pot was heated on a charcoal fire at the table and the raw ingredients presented on one big plate.\nIn 1957, a restaurant called Coca opened its first branch in Soi Tantawan, Bangkok, offering a modified version of the Chinese hot pot under the Japanese name of Sukiyaki. Although it only vaguely resembled Japanese sukiyaki, it was a catchy name for it because of a Japanese pop song called \"Sukiyaki\" which was a big worldwide hit at the time.  This modified Thai version proved to be a massive hit, and it wasn't long before other chains started opening \"suki\" restaurants across Bangkok and other cities, each with its own special dipping sauce as the selling point.\nIn Thai sukiyaki, diners have more options of ingredients to choose from, each portion being considerably smaller in order to enable diners to order many more varieties. The spicy dipping sauce (nam chim suki) caters to Thai tastes, too, with much chili sauce, chili, lime and coriander leaves added. The raw ingredients are presented on small plates and are cooked at the table in a gas- or electrically heated stainless steel pot containing broth. Usually, an egg is added to the broth at the start of the meal.\nToday the MK Restaurant chain, which opened its first restaurant in 1962 on Siam Square in Bangkok, is the most popular in Thailand with around 430 restaurants across the country and 23 in Japan. Coca is making a rapid spread abroad, too, already serving Thai suki in 24 outlets across Asia and Australia and further outlets planned in the US and Europe.  Other popular chains include Texas and Lailai.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Thai suki at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "Dongaseu (Korean: \ub3c8\uac00\uc2a4) is a Korean dish of Japanese origin that consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. The name comes from the Japanese word tonkatsu.\n\nHistory\nThe dish was introduced to Korea around 1930s during the period of Japanese rule, but the thick, Japanese-style tonkatsu failed to gain popularity. Don-gaseu became popular in the 1960s, with the spread of gyeong-yangsik\u2014light western food\u2014restaurants. The dish, although called by the Japanese-derived name don-gaseu, followed Western pork cutlet recipes such as those of the Austrian Schnitzel\u2014thinned by pounding before being breaded and deep-fried. It was not sliced, and served with bread. Western-style appetizer soup was served before the dish. Don-gaseu developed into two distinct varieties. In 1977, gyeong-yangsik-style don-gaseu with thin meat became a popular menu in gisa-sikdang\u2014drivers' restaurant, similar to transport caf\u00e9, for taxi drivers\u2014with the addition of chili peppers and kimchi as an accompaniment. As gyeong-yangsik restaurants nearly disappeared, this style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in drivers' restaurants and bunsik-jip (snack restaurants). A second style of don-gaseu, with thicker meat and served sliced following the Japanese method, was made popular in 1983 by a restaurant called Myeongdong Dongaseu. This style of don-gaseu is now commonly served in authentic Japanese restaurants.\n\nPreparation and serving\nKorean don-gaseu is different from Japanese tonkatsu in that it is thinner and often served unsliced, thus eaten with a knife and fork, not chopsticks, and is served with demi-glace on top of the fried meat (or in case of fish cutlet, tartar sauce on the fried fish). Common accompaniments include shredded cabbage sprinkled with ketchup-mayonnaise mixture, baked beans, macaroni salad, sweet corn, and danmuji (yellow pickled radish). Green chili peppers and doenjang (soybean paste) or ssamjang (wrap sauce) for dipping the chili peppers, baechu-kimchi (cabbage kimchi) or kkakdugi (radish kimchi), and rice with Korean or Japanese style soup can be served with the don-gaseu plate. Alternatively, bread can replace rice, in which case Western-style soup is served before the main plate as an appetizer.\n\nVariations\nSaengseon-gaseu (\uc0dd\uc120\uac00\uc2a4), a fish cutlet similar to don-gaseu, is served with tartar sauce, instead of demi-glace.\n\nSee also\nList of pork dishes\nTonkatsu, a similar Japanese dish\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Doubles is a common street food originating in Trinidad and Tobago with Indian origin. It is normally eaten during breakfast, but is also eaten occasionally during lunch or as a late night snack and popular hangover food for local Trinidadians. Doubles is made with two baras (flat fried dough) and filled with curry channa (curried chickpeas) and various chutneys.\n\nOrigins\nDoubles as a dish was created in Princes Town by Emamool Deen (a.k.a. Mamoodeen) and his wife Raheman Rasulan Deen in 1936.It has been speculated that it was inspired by a northern Indian dish called chole bhature (or sometimes channa bhatura). Chole bhature is made by combining channa masala and bhature (poori), which is a fried bread made with maida flour, a common flour in Indian baking.Mamoodeen used to sell curried channa (chickpeas) over single baras (fried flatbread) with chutneys to the Indian sugar estate workers in the early 20th century. When his customers began requesting to double the bara in their orders the name \u201cdoubles\u201d was coined.\n\nPreparation\nDoubles can be served spicy, sweet, or savory.  Condiments include spicy pepper sauce, kuchela, or green mango, bandhaniya, cucumber, coconut, pommecythere, tamarind chutney, and chadon beni sauce.\n\nCultural significance\nGiven the diversity of Trinidad, doubles is credited with its ability to \"define and maintain symbolic boundaries of identification\", and is considered an authentic standard of Trinidadian cuisine. Doubles is a comfort food for displaced Trinidadians in major cities across the globe. Its consumption has been credited with developing a \"deep psychological imprinting\" among them, and as such is considered culturally significant for how it encapsulated Trinidadian identity into a simple and unique snack.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Trinidad and Tobago\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDoubles Recipe\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/C20U1lKOxOx/?igsh=MXkxeWpzNHV3Y2VsYg==",

        "body": "Xiaolongbao () refers to a type of small Chinese steamed bun (baozi) traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, a small bamboo steaming basket. Xiaolongbao are often referred to as a kind of \"dumpling\", but are distinct from Chinese jiaozi or wonton. \nIn some parts of China and overseas, xiao long bao may specifically refer to a kind of soup dumpling, the tangbao (Chinese: \u6c64\u5305) of Jiangnan cuisine, which are strongly associated with Shanghai and Wuxi. In Shanghainese, these are also known as siaulon moedeu or xiaolong mantou, as Wu Chinese-speaking peoples use the traditional definition of \"mantou\", which refers to both filled and unfilled buns. Shengjianbao are very similar to tangbao but are pan-fried instead of steamed.\n\nOrigins\n\"Xiaolongbao\" originated in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, by Wan Hua Tea House in the years of Daoguang Emperor (1820 to 1850). Xiaolongbao evolved from the guantangbao (soup-filled dumplings/buns) from Kaifeng, Henan province, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty (AD 960\u20131127).\nThere are numerous styles of xiaolongbao in Jiangsu cuisine. Shanghai-style xiaolongbao originated in Nanxiang, which was a neighboring village of Shanghai in Jiangsu that eventually ended up becoming an outer suburb of Shanghai's Jiading District. The inventor of xiaolongbao sold them in his first store in Nanxiang next to the town's notable park, Guyi Garden. From there the xiaolongbao expanded into downtown Shanghai and outward. The Suzhou and Wuxi styles are larger (sometimes twice as large as a Nanxiang-style soup dumpling) and have sweeter fillings. The Nanjing style is smaller with an almost translucent skin and less meat.\n\nIngredients\nChinese buns, in general, may be divided into two types, depending on the degree of leavening of the flour skin. Buns can be made with leavened or unleavened dough. Those made with unleavened dough use clear water for mixing, the skin is thin and the fillings large. It is frequently made in Nanxiang but is imitated elsewhere, calling it Xiang-style. Steamed buns made with raised flour are seen throughout China and are what is usually referred to as mantou. Steamed xiaolongbao made with partially raised flour are more commonly seen in the south. This means that their skin is tender, smoother, and somewhat translucent, rather than being white and fluffy. As is traditional for buns of various sizes in the Jiangnan region, xiaolongbao is pinched at the top prior to steaming, so the skin has a circular cascade of ripples around the crown.\nXiaolongbao are traditionally filled with pork. More modern innovations include other meats, seafood, shrimp, crab meat, and vegetarian fillings.\nSoup dumplings are created by wrapping solid meat aspic inside the skin alongside the meat filling. Heat from steaming then melts the gelatin-gelled aspic into soup. In modern times, refrigeration has made the process of making tangbao during hot weather easier, since making gelled aspic is much more difficult at room temperature.\n\nServing\nXiaolongbao are traditionally eaten for breakfast. The buns are served hot in the bamboo baskets in which they were steamed, usually on a bed of dried leaves or paper mat, although some restaurants now use napa cabbage instead. The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with chili crisp.\n\nTraditionally, tangbao soup dumplings are a kind of dim sum (\u00e0 la carte item) or \"xiaochi\" (snack). The buns are usually dipped in Zhenjiang vinegar with ginger slivers. They are traditionally served with a clear soup on the side. Around Shanghai, \"tangbao\" may be eaten throughout the day, although usually not for breakfast. They form part of a traditional Jiangnan-style morning tea (\u65e9\u8336). In Guangdong and the West, it is sometimes served as a dish during Cantonese tea time. Frozen tangbao are now mass-produced and a popular frozen food sold worldwide.\n\nTypes\nChangzhou\nThe modern form of Xiaolongbao originated from Qing Dynasty. A place named YingGui Teahouse is where people in ChangZhou go to have Xiaolongbao. Xiaolongbao in Changzhou is known for its thin wraps, great taste of its ingredients, and the soup that spills out when taken a bite. Among the types, crab filled Xiaolongbao is the most well known type in Changzhou that are served after the mid autumn festival.\n\nShanghai\nNanxiang Xiaolongbao in Shanghai have around a hundred year of history. They are known for their unique technique of making the wrappers as well as secret ingredients of the fillings.\n\nTianjin\nGoubuli Xiaolongbao is the most famous Xiaolongbao in the northern China. Goubuli is founded in 1858 by a young man named Gouzi, who named his xiaolongbao after himself as Goubuli later. Goubuli Xiaolongbao has strictly 18 wrinkles on each dumpling due to its creator's unique method of making it. Goubuli Xiaolongbao were served to one of the famous queen's mother in Chinese history as a famous dish from Tianjin.\n\nKaifeng\nKaifeng Xiaolongbao, created in Song Dynasty, is also known as soup filled Xiaolongbao. Many famous cooks created their own ways of making soup filled dumplings in Kaifeng and improved the techniques throughout history. Kaifeng Xiaolongbao looks like \"a lantern\" when you lift the dumpling and \"a flower\" when it sits in the steaming basket.\n\nSee also\nExplanatory notes\n\n\n== Citations ==",

        "body": "Fried okra is a side dish associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States, particularly soul food. It is made by coating sliced okra in cornmeal and then frying it.\n\nHistory\nOkra is a staple of the cuisine of the Southern United States, with fried okra being the most popular method of preparation. Okra was first transported to the Americas by slave ships during the Atlantic slave trade. The method of frying okra is believed to have roots in the Congo or West Africa before being transported to the United States. During the mid-19th century, fried vegetables and fritters became increasingly popular in the South which contributed to the popularity of fried okra.Fried okra is popularly served at barbecues and restaurants in the South, especially as part of a meat and three. It is often consumed during the summer, when okra is in season. It has been called \"Southern popcorn\". The dish is associated with soul food, Cajun and Gullah Geechee cuisine. It is included in the Oklahoma state meal, a menu based on the agricultural and culinary history of Oklahoma that is an official state symbol.\n\nPreparation\nThe basic preparation of fried okra is simple, requiring okra that has been dredged in oil and fried. The okra pods are cut into slices and then tossed or dredged in cornmeal before frying in butter or vegetable oil. Either deep frying and pan frying may be used. More complex recipes involve dipping the okra in eggs or buttermilk prior to dredging in cornmeal or cornmeal and flour. Another method of preparation calls for a cornmeal batter that includes beaten eggs. This batter may be seasoned with ingredients such as black pepper and cayenne pepper.Okra can become slimy when sliced. Cutting the okra into small pieces before frying allows it to maintain a crispier exterior texture, but results in a slimier interior. Whole okra pods may also be fried.It is typically served as a side dish, sometimes with a dipping sauce such as remoulade.\n\n\n== References ==",

It consists of shrimp coated in a flour, egg, beer and cornstarch batter (known in French as \u00e0 l'Orly) and then deep fried in olive oil. The tails are left during cooking as the shrimp is eaten by hand. The batter may have a yellow tint due to the use of saffron.

        "body": "Songpyeon (Korean: \uc1a1\ud3b8; Hanja: \u677e\u4b4f) is a traditional Korean food made of rice powder. Its shape resembles a half moon and it is a representative rice cake of Korean holidays and traditional culture. It is a type of tteok, small rice cakes, and variety of fillings are used\u2014some include red bean paste, toasted sesame seeds, and chestnuts. Songpyeon is traditionally eaten during the Korean autumn harvest festival, Chuseok, where it is often prepared by families at home. It is a popular symbol of traditional Korean culture. The earliest records of songpyeon date from the Goryeo period.\n\nDescription\nSongpyeons are half-moon shaped rice cakes that typically contain sweet or semi-sweet fillings, such as soybeans, cowpeas, chestnuts, jujubes, dates, red beans, sesame seeds, or honey. They are steamed over a layer of pine needles, which gives them a distinctive taste and the fragrant smell of fresh pine trees. The colors typically include white (\ud770 \uc1a1\ud3b8, hwinsongpyeon), green (\uc219 \uc1a1\ud3b8, ssuksongpyeon), red (\uc1a1\uc774 \uc1a1\ud3b8, songgisongpyeon), and yellow (\uce58\uc790 \uc1a1\ud3b8, chijasongpyeon). Songpyeon is typically enjoyed during the Korean holiday, Chuseok, where it is shared amongst family, friends, and neighbors. It is also enjoyed with liquor on this special occasion. \"Song\" refers to pine needles.\n\nCulture\nSongpyeon is quintessential to Korean families' Chuseok celebrations. Traditionally, songpyeon was made by Korean families using freshly harvested rice and then offered to their ancestors on the morning of Chuseok as thanks for the bountiful harvest during charye (\ucc28\ub840; \u8336\u79ae), an ancestral memorial ritual. Songpyeon is also given to other family members and close neighbors. Such offerings are viewed as signs of respect and efforts to avoid bad luck within the family.Songpyeon is used to show gratitude for the year's harvest by placing it on a table with other foods, included newly harvested fruit, and taro. These three foods symbolize, respectively, the fruit of the heavens, the fruit of the earth, and the fruit of the underground.Songpyeon is also said to represent the moon and wishes, which is why people will say their wishes while making and eating it. Many stories describe why songpyeon is in the shape of a half moon rather than a full moon. The most common belief is that Korean ancestors thought that a round-shaped full moon could only wane while a half-moon would fill up. This is considered a sign of abundance and prosperity.  Songpyeon resembles a full moon shape before being folded and transforms into a half moon when folded with filling.One explanation of Songpyeon's half moon shape stems from a historical anecdote from King Uija's reign. In the anecdote, a turtle once came to the palace with a carving on his back that read \"Silla is half moon.\", which represented a hopeful future for the kingdom.Another Korean anecdote says that the person who makes beautifully-shaped songpyeon will meet a good spouse or give birth to a beautiful baby.\n\nPreparation\nSongpyeon is made by kneading rice flour with salt and hot water until it is smooth in order to create a dough. Small pieces of the dough are torn off, rolled into balls and then indented in the center using a thumb. The filling of choice is placed inside the now hollowed center and then the ball is sealed closed and shaped. The rice cakes are steamed on top of pine needles for about 20\u201330 minutes and then rinsed with cold water in order to maintain their chewy texture. The rice cakes are then blotted dry and typically finished by being brushed with sesame oil.Steaming the rice cakes on top of pine needles gives them a unique taste and scent, and also helps to prevent the rice cakes from sticking together while steaming. As pine trees also produce large amounts of phytoncide, this effectively kills germs, and helps avoid spoiling due to the presence of terpene.According to the Dongui Bogam (\ub3d9\uc758\ubcf4\uac10; \u6771\u91ab\u5bf6\u9451), the most well-known Joseon medical book, the pine needles are also said to have medicinal effects on the food.\n\nRegional Differences\nAlthough the cultural significance of songpyeon remains the same, differences in color, shape, ingredients, and even thickness can be found across Korea.\n\nChungcheong Province\nAs pumpkin is widely grown in this region, Chungcheong Province is known for its pumpkin songpyeon. The pumpkins are dried and ground into a powder which is then mixed with the rice flour to make the dough. The rice cakes are often shaped to look like small pumpkins. The result is a sweet rice cake that is bright in color.\n\nGangwon Province\nWith an abundance of potato crops and oak trees, Gangwon Province is known for its potato songpyeon and acorn songpyeon. These rice cakes are made with potato starch and acorn powder, respectively. The songpyeon in this region are typically flat with ridges from pressing down using fingers and in Gangneung, people leave their handprints on the rice cakes.\n\nGyeongsang Province\nSongpyeon made in Gyeongsang Province are typically larger than the songpyeon found in other regions. A popular type of songpyeon found here is ramie songpyeon, which consists of boiled ramie leaves which are added to the rice cakes to make them healthier.\n\nJeju Province\nA traditional filling for songpyeon made on Jeju Island is sweetened peas. The songpyeon are sometimes shaped with a concave center to resemble a volcanic crater and are often pan-fried after being steamed.\n\nJeolla Province\nSongpyeon made in Jeolla Province sometimes contains arrowroot starch which is combined with rice flour to make the rice cake dough. Jeolla Province is also known for its flower songpyeon which are made with natural dyes and made to resemble flowers either by hand or by using a mold.\n\nSeoul\nSeoul is known for its small, five-colored or osaek songpyeon (\uc624\uc0c9\uc1a1\ud3b8). The five colors\u2014white, brown, pink, green, and yellow\u2014represent the harmony of nature. White songpyeon lacks any color additives, but the other colors are obtained using natural ingredients. Brown is created using cinnamon; pink, by using strawberry or omija syrup; green, by using mugwort; and yellow, by using gardenia seeds.\n\nNorth Korea\nThe traditional songpyeon made in Pyeongan Province in North Korea is seashell songpyeon. The name of this songpyeon is attributed to its seashell shape. Its filling consists of sesame seeds, sugar, and soy sauce.\n\nSee also\nKusamochi, the Japanese form of this dish\nCaozaiguo, a similar Chinese dish\nTteok\nKorean cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nChuseok Holiday Food, SongPyeon\nSongpyeon - Official Seoul City Tourism\nSongpyeon (Half-moon Shaped Rice Cake)\nTraditional Korean Holiday, Chuseok",

He has also been a judge on the television show Deep Fry Masters.\n\nEarly life\nThe son of a Tex-Mex restaurateur, Gonzales was born in Dallas, Texas, in November 1969. In his youth he grew up working long hours around his father's restaurant, A. J. Gonzales\u2019 Mexican Oven and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School where he was later inducted into their hall of fame in 2014.\n\nState Fair of Texas\nSince 2004, Gonzales has been entering into the Big Tex Choice Award contest, a contest for the most creative deep fried food, and has been a finalist every year except for 2014. He has won the contest five times in categories such as \"best taste\" and\n\"most creative\" with multiple deep fried inventions. In 2004, he won with the fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich, in 2005 with Fried Coke, in 2006 with fried cookie dough, in 2008 with deep-fried butter, and in 2011 with Fried Jambalaya. Other finalist inventions have included chicken-fried cactus bites, jelly and banana sandwiches, and deep fried pineapple rings.\n\nCareer\nGonzales worked as a database analyst before quitting his job in 2009 to work selling his deep fried foods at the Texas state fair. This allows him to spend the rest of the year traveling and experimenting with new forms of deep fried foods. He has also been hired previously by a beer distribution company to create a variant of deep fried beer. In 2014 he became a judge on the deep fried themed cooking show Deep Fry Masters.In 2017, Gonzales opened a Dallas restaurant called Republic Ranch which featured \"a blending of Mexican food and barbecue\". It featured tacos with fillings such as ribeye and pulled pork as well as fried chicken and brisket. Gonzales left Ranch Republic in 2018 and the following year opened a New York-style Italian cuisine restaurant called Cocina Italiano in Dallas. It focuses on low cost pastas, sandwiches, and salads similar to food he encountered in New York City and Boston.\n\n\n== References ==",

The meat is first washed then put in a mixture of citrus juices to add flavor.  After being soaked in the citrus juices, the meat is marinated in epis, which is a mixture of Haitian herbs, vegetables, and spices. Next, the meat is either braised or roasted until tender. The cooking liquid produced is used in the preparation of an accompanying sauce, known as s\u00f2s ti-malis. Finally, the meat is deep-fried until golden-brown and crispy.

Historical documents substantiate that Osmania Biscuits were initially introduced during the Nizam's reign, highlighting their aristocratic beginnings.\nThe development of Osmania Biscuits was significantly influenced by Turkish and Persian baking customs, contributing to their distinctive flavor profile and texture. This historical connection adds depth to their culinary heritage, reflecting a synthesis of cultures in the creation of this iconic treat.\nThese biscuits have become synonymous with the cultural identity of Hyderabad, particularly in areas like Charminar and Old Hyderabad. Osmania Biscuits have become an integral part of the local culinary scene, often paired with the renowned Irani chai.\nBeyond the boundaries of Hyderabad, variations of Osmania Biscuits can be found in Tamil Nadu, with the name 'butter biscuit' of Chennai bearing a striking resemblance. Also 'ooty biscuits' found in Ooty is similar made. But both have no cultural touch with each other as each of the types originated around similar historical period. This widespread popularity underscores the enduring appeal of Osmania Biscuits, not just within the city but also as a cultural delicacy recognized throughout India and beyond.\n\nSee also\nFlour kurabiye\n\nReferences\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/osmania-biscuit-an-alltime-favourite/article2657076.ece\nhttps://www.newstap.in/city-news/the-last-nizam-and-his-everlasting-osmania-biscuits-1485264?infinitescroll=1\nAuthor, A.

They are very popular in Malta and they are sold in street markets, as well as in village feasts, in some cases served with ice-cream.During preparation the imqaret are deep fried and are usually infused with the flavours of aniseed and bay leaf. The imqaret are prepared individually by folding the pastry, in the centre of which a quantity of filling is placed. As the pastry is long, several imqaret pieces are then cut from each pastry following the deep frying process.Imqaret are of Arabic origin, introduced during the period of the Arab invasion of the island between 870 AD and the 11th century, while a similar sweet named makroudh or maqrud or makroud exists across the sea in Tunisia, which is also popular across Algeria and Morocco with the names makrout, maqrout, mqaret.\n\nSee also\nList of street foods\n\n\n== References ==",

The oysters used in the dish are either Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster) or Crassostrea nippona (Iwagaki oyster).\n\nPreparation\nThe dish is prepared by coating raw oysters with flour and then covering them with panko flakes, a type of bread crumb.  The oysters are then deep-fried at about 180 \u00b0C (360 \u00b0F) for roughly two minutes, at which point, they should appear golden brown.\n\nVariation\nIn 2019, the government of Hiroshima Prefecture came up with a variation of the dish in which the bread coating remained white.  This was done by frying the oysters at a lower temperature, about 120 \u00b0C (250 \u00b0F), for a few minutes.\n\n\n== References ==",

It has a deep brown and pitted appearance, and takes the form of a bite-sized pillow or short cylinder. Although traditional karint\u014d is coated with brown sugar, recently other variations appear in the market, such as white sugar, sesame seeds, miso, or peanuts.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Spirit of Justice, police detective and forensic scientist Ema Skye constantly eats karint\u014d on duty (the snack was localized as chocolate-flavored \"snackoos\").In Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, karint\u014d is stated to be one of Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu's favourite foods.In Gosick, Kujo gives karint\u014d to Victorique, who comments that they look like dog feces.In Lycoris Recoil, karint\u014d are a staple food at the dorm.In Mirmo!, karinto is Yashichi\u2019s favorite food.In Magical Emi episode 34, karint\u014d are featured as a snack a character spends the entire episode trying to conquer his fear of.\n\nHistory\nKarint\u014d's roots are unclear, with primary origination theories being either from around the Nara Period or being derived from a Portuguese snack in a later period.  In either case it has been available from street merchants since at least the Tenp\u014d era, roughly from 1830 to 1841.",

        "body": "Pfeffern\u00fcsse are small spice cookies, popular as a holiday treat with Germans and ethnic Mennonites in North America. Similar cookies are made in Denmark, and The Netherlands, as well. They are called Pfeffern\u00fcsse (plural, singular is Pfeffernuss) in German, pepernoten (sing. pepernoot) in Dutch, p\u00e4pan\u00e4t in Plautdietsch, pfeffernusse or peppernuts in English, and pebern\u00f8dder in Danish.\n\nHistory\nJohann Fleischmann, a confectioner from Offenbach am Main, created the recipe in 1753. Goethe praised the pastries. Felix Mendelssohn went to Offenbach am Main especially to buy them. The state of Hesse has served it at state receptions.\nIn 1820, the Brothers Grimm warned their sister Charlotte (de) against excessive consumption: \"Don't eat too much of the pepper nuts, they are said to cause a lot of heat!\" At that time, nutmeg was considered an aphrodisiac, and cardamom as invigorating as caffeine.\nIn Germany, Pfeffern\u00fcsse are associated with Christmas. The cookie has been part of yuletide celebrations since the 1850s.The name literally means 'peppernuts', and does not mean it contains nuts. The cookies are roughly the size of nuts and can be eaten by the handful, which may account for the name. They are named for the pinch of pepper added to the dough before baking.\n\nIngredients\nThough Pfeffern\u00fcsse cookie recipes differ, all contain aromatic spices \u2013 most commonly cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, black pepper, mace, and anise. Molasses, sugar, and honey are used to sweeten the cookies. Some variations are dusted with powdered sugar, though that is not a traditional ingredient. The dough is butter, shortening, or margarine, eggs, and flour.Leavening agents such as baking powder, baking soda, potassium carbonate, or ammonium carbonate get the sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture. It is then kneaded either by hand or through the use of an electric mixer.\n\nGerman variety\nIn northern Germany, Pfeffern\u00fcsse are a hemispherical pastry up to two centimetres in diameter and of firm consistency.\nThe northern Moppen variant are larger and softer, based on a gingerbread-like dough, and have an icing glaze.\nIn southern Germany, the dough is made with candied lemon peel or orange peel, orange zest, lemon zest, and often also almonds.\nIn Saxony, they are about three centimetres, uncoated and angular.\nThere are some recipes passed down by families of German Mennonite origin that call for peppermint extract rather than the traditional spices, making for a light minty flavor. These cookies are cooked to be soft and coated in powdered sugar. Specific origin of this variation is unknown.\n\nDutch variation\nThe Netherlands gives the name kruidnoten to the small, brown, round cookies, while pepernoten concerns a chewy snack that is lighter in color and has a chunky, angular appearance. Even though they are perceivably different, some Dutch residents mistakenly call kruidnoten pepernoten and online stores list them under this category as well.Both are holiday-exclusive snacks and available in any store that sells food around Sinterklaas time. Pepernoten are one of the earliest Sinterklaas candies, yet have become relatively rare, as most children do not prefer them.Meanwhile, the kruidnoten recipe has become the subject of experimentation and been heavily expanded on throughout the years. Besides the regular variant and packages that include gummies and sugar candies, kruidnoten can be covered with a layer of (white/milk/pure/truffle) chocolate \u2013 which is one of the earliest and most loved variants \u2013 but also strawberry, caramel, stroopwafel, coconut, coffee, bubblegum, cake (any), etc.\n\nCommonly mistaken for Pfeffern\u00fcsse\nPfeffern\u00fcsse are commonly mistaken for kruidnoten or spice nuts in English. While they are both famous holiday cookies, kruidnoten are harder, have a darker brown color, and have a different shape. Their ingredients are more similar to those used in speculaas.\nRussian tea cakes are also confused with pfeffern\u00fcsse, especially when dusted in powdered sugar.\n\nSee also\nMuskazine\nLebkuchen\nAachener Printen\nStollen\nSpeculaas\nBaumkuchen\nSpringerle\nVanillekipferl\nBethm\u00e4nnchen\nde:Heidesand\nde:Zimtstern\nde:Berliner Brot\nKruidnoten (Dutch)\nPepernoot (Dutch)\nMacaroon (de)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Offenbacher Pfeffern\u00fcsse - Rezept\".

It is prepared in a rice cooker. The rice is often mixed with chicken stock and soy sauce before adding the fried chicken. Per its name, the fried chicken used is typically the Original Recipe chicken sold by the American fast food chain KFC, though the dish can be made with any other type of fried chicken. The dish is generally said to have originated in Japan, where KFC is notably popular.\n\nHistory\nAccording to Mashable, KFC rice originated from a 1974 marketing campaign that encouraged Japanese families to cook the dish at home. A similar recipe using the same name was published by English-language Japanese culture website SoraNews24 in 2013, albeit using additional ingredients such as diced tomatoes and shimeji.KFC rice was popularized in December 2019 following the publication of an article detailing its preparation in the Japanese publication Gadget News, and it was popularized online in East Asia and the Western world as a \"KFC rice cooker hack\" for making a simple, flavorful rice dish. Some sources, such as Ilyas Sholihyn of Singaporean lifestyle website AsiaOne, have suggested it was intended as a quick, cheap Christmas dinner, owing to the timing of the article's publication and the popularity of KFC in Japan around Christmas.Despite its name, KFC rice is not actually an official KFC menu item sold in any region. Though KFC does sell rice dishes in certain regions\u2014such as chicken katsu rice bowls in Japan, jollof rice topped with fried chicken in Nigeria, and zongzi in China\u2014these are separate dishes that are prepared differently from KFC rice.\n\nPreparation\nPer numerous sources, including KFC's official global website, KFC rice is prepared by mixing uncooked rice with chicken stock and soy sauce, then steaming it with two or more whole pieces of fried chicken in a rice cooker. The fried chicken and other ingredients impart an umami fried chicken flavor to the rice without affecting the chicken's texture. After cooking, the fried chicken is shredded and mixed with the rice, and the bones are removed.

She recommended it for those on a tight budget or for meal prep, and suggested experimenting with the addition of vegetables and using fried chicken from other fast food chains such as Popeyes and Bojangles.Sukhbir Cheema of Mashable SEA noted KFC rice would negatively affect any plans of maintaining a healthy diet, and suggested adding chopped carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, or lettuce to balance it out.\n\nSee also\nHainanese chicken rice\nList of rice dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Sambal is an Indonesian chili sauce or paste, typically made from a mixture of a variety of chilli peppers with secondary ingredients such as shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, and lime juice. Sambal is an Indonesian loanword of Javanese origin (sambel). It originated from the culinary traditions of Indonesia and is also an integral part of the cuisines of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Sri Lanka. It has also spread through overseas Indonesian populations to the Netherlands and Suriname.Various recipes of sambals are usually served as hot and spicy condiments for dishes, such as lalab (raw vegetables), ikan bakar (grilled fish), ikan goreng (fried fish), ayam goreng (fried chicken), ayam penyet (smashed chicken), iga penyet (ribs), and various soto soups. There are 212 variants of sambal in Indonesia, with most of them originating in Java.\n\nHistory\nSambal is often described as a hot and spicy Indonesian relish. However, its main ingredient, chili pepper of the genus Capsicum, is not native to Southeast Asia, but from the Americas. Common variants used in sambal recipes include Cayenne pepper and bird's eye chili pepper (both varieties of Capsicum annuum). These variants are native to the Western Hemisphere and were introduced to the Indonesian archipelago in the 16th century by Portuguese and Spanish sailors during the Columbian exchange.\nResearchers note that the people of the Maritime Southeast Asia were already familiar with a type of hot and spicy relish prior to the 16th century. A hot spice called cabya had become a valuable commodity in the Javanese market as early as the ancient Mataram Kingdom era, circa the 10th century. The 14th century Majapahit Javanese Nagarakretagama manuscript mentions lombok mirah island which is identified as Lombok island, which is also the area that produced a spice called red lombok. In today's modern Javanese, the term lombok refers to 'chilli pepper', yet the term probably originally referred to a native hot spice prior to the introduction of capsicum. The Indonesian languages' terms for 'chilli pepper' are cabai or cabe, yet the word cabya is mentioned in several ancient inscriptions and texts found in Java from the 10th century CE. Cabya is actually a reference to the Javanese long pepper or Balinese long pepper (Piper retrofractum). Historians suggest that prior to the introduction of Capsicum from the Americas in the 16th century, it was cabya that was widely used and cultivated as a hot spice in Java. Cabya is still used in Java, but the overwhelming popularity of the capsicum plants eventually pushed out cabya consumption until it was only used in traditional herbal medication and in making jamu (Javanese traditional herbal drink). Nowadays, the plant is considered rare. Another historian suggests that it was ginger that was used as a hot spice agent in the ancient form of sambal. Ginger, cabya, and andaliman are among the earliest hot spices used in early sambal-like hot relish, followed by the introduction of pepper circa 12th century from India, and finally the introduction of chili pepper from the Americas in the 16th century.The Javanese manuscript Serat Centhini (1819\u20131912) records sixteen sambal variants in Java. The recipe book Mustika Rasa (1967), written and composed by Hartini Sukarno, presented 63 recipes of sambals. In 2017, Murdijati Gardjito, a food researcher from Gadjah Mada University, identified hundreds of variants of sambals in Indonesia; 212 of them have a clear origin, while 43 have an unclear origin. Java has the most of variants with 43 percent of sambal variants, \nSumatra has 20 percent, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara has 8 percent, and the rest are distributed between Maluku, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi.Like many culinary introductions and adaptations in the archipelago, over the years this hot and spicy relish branched off into an assorted array of sambal varieties, localised according to regional taste and the availability of the ingredients. Today sambal is a staple of Southeast Asian households, essential in cuisines of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nPreparation and availability\nTraditional sambals are freshly made using traditional tools, such as a stone pestle and mortar. Sambal can be served raw or cooked. There are two main categories of sambals in Indonesia, they are sambal masak (cooked) and sambal mentah (raw). Cooked sambal has undergone a cooking process that resulted in a distinct flavour and aroma, while raw sambal is mixed with additional ingredients and usually consumed immediately. Sambal masak or cooked sambals are more prevalent in western Indonesia, while sambal mentah or raw sambals are more common in eastern Indonesia.The chilli pepper, garlic, shallot, and tomato are often freshly ground using a mortar, while the terasi or belacan (shrimp paste) is fried or burned first to kill its pungent smell as well as to release its aroma. Sambal might be prepared in bulk, as it can be easily stored in a well-sealed glass jar in the refrigerator for a week to be served with meals as a condiment. However, some households and restaurants insist on making freshly prepared sambal just a few moments prior to consuming to ensure its freshness and flavour; this is known as sambal dadak (lit. 'impromptu sambal' or 'freshly made sambal'). Nevertheless, in most warung and restaurants, most sambal is prepared daily in bulk and offered as a hot and spicy condiment.\n\nToday some brands of prepared, pre-packed, instant or ready-to-use sambal are available in Indonesia in warung, traditional markets, supermarkets, and convenience stores. Most are bottled sambal, with a few brands available in plastic or aluminium sachet packaging. Compared to traditional sambals, bottled instant sambals often have a finer texture, more homogenous content, and thicker consistency, like tomato ketchup, due to the machine-driven manufacturing process. Traditionally made sambals ground in a pestle and mortar usually have a coarse texture and consistency. Several brands produce bottled sambals such as Heinz ABC sambal terasi and several variants of sambal Indofood. In the Netherlands a limited range of pre-packed sambals in glass or plastic jar is readily available from several brands (national and store brands) from almost all supermarkets and tokos.\n\nVarieties of chili\nThe most common kinds of peppers used in sambal are:\n\nAdyuma, also known as habanero: a very spicy, yellow, and block-shaped pepper.\nCayenne pepper: a shiny, red, and elongated pepper.\nMadame Jeanette: a yellow\u2013light green, elongated, irregularly shaped pepper.\nBird's eye chili, also known as cabe rawit in Javanese: a very spicy, green\u2013red, elongated pepper approximately 10 millimetres (0.39 in) wide and 50 mm (2.0 in) long.\nChili peppers known as lombok in Javanese: a mild, green or red, elongated pepper. Green chili peppers are milder than red ones.\nCabe taliwang: a pepper spicier than the Bird's eye chili, similar in spiciness to the naga jolokia, its name is supposedly the origin from which Lombok Island, or \"the Island of the Chili\", derives its name.\n\nIndonesia\nIn the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 212 to 300 varieties of sambal. The intensity ranges from mild to very hot. Some varieties include:\n\nSambal andaliman\nSimilar to sambal lado mudo but with the addition of andaliman pepper.\nSambal asam\nThis is similar to sambal terasi with an addition of tamarind concentrate.

        "body": "Manjar branco is a pure white Brazilian coconut pudding similar to blancmange. It is identical to the Puerto Rican tembleque. In Brazil manjar branco is made in a ring (Savarin) mold and is served with a sauce made of pitted prunes poached in port wine.  Commercial mixes for manjar branco and tembleque are available in Brazil, the U.S., and in other Latin American countries.\nIn order to improve the texture and taste, unsweetened shredded coconut may be added to the mix.\nManjar branco in Portugal usually refers to blancmange, but there is another dessert that shares the name. The Manjar branco of Coimbra is an unusual dessert, made from chicken breast, milk, sugar, rice flour, orange zest, and salt.\n\nSee also\nMaja blanca\nManjar blanco\nList of Brazilian sweets and desserts\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Mozzarella sticks are elongated pieces of battered or breaded mozzarella, usually served as hors d'oeuvre.\n\nOrigins\nThe history of frying cheese in a batter dates back to at least 1393 in medieval France, when a recipe for fried cheese sticks appeared in Le M\u00e9nagier de Paris. However, food historians believe that medieval French fried cheeses had little in common with the preparation and development of modern mozzarella sticks.Mozzarella sticks likely have their origins in the United States during the 1970s, through a combination of two factors, as per historian Joel Jensen: \"the increasing availability of mass-produced mozzarella cheese beginning in the 1960s\", and the development of new efficient frying technologies to be used in fast-paced food-serving businesses (such as bowling alleys and sports bars).\n\nPreparation\nMozzarella sticks are prepared by coating cheese strings in breadcrumbs or batter. They may be baked or fried in oil. Mozzarella sticks are often served with tomato sauce or marinara sauce. However, they may be served with other dipping sauces such as plum sauce, jalape\u00f1o jelly, ketchup, barbecue sauce, honey mustard sauce, and ranch dressing. Restaurants often serve fried mozzarella sticks with a marinara sauce.\n\nVariations\nPopular fried cheeses other than mozzarella include provolone, Edam, cheddar, and American. Mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce are part of the regional cuisine of New York's Capital District.In many public schools throughout the United States, Bosco pizza sticks filled with mozzarella have become a popular staple.\n\nSee also\nLumpiang keso\nSorullos\nTeque\u00f1os\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Vanillekipferl are Austrian, German, Swiss, Czech, Slovak, Polish and Hungarian small, crescent-shaped biscuits. They were originally made with walnuts, but almonds or hazelnuts can also be used. They get their typical flavour from a heavy dusting of vanilla sugar.\n\nOrigins\nVanillekipferl originate from Vienna in Austria and are traditionally made at Christmas. They are very well known in Europe and are often for sale in Viennese coffee shops and bakeries, especially during Christmas time. They are said to have been created in the shape of the Turkish crescent moon symbolizing the celebration of the victory over the Turkish in 1683 at the Battle of Vienna.\nThey are also widely baked in Germany and are common in Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania,  Slovakia and among the Danube Swabian diaspora as a part of the typical Christmas baking. Since Advent in Germany is celebrated by several denominations of Christianity on the four Sundays preceding Christmas, many kinds of biscuits and sweets are consumed during this time and have become typical for winter.Unlike other pastries, this particular kind is difficult to bake. The raw dough is very soft because it contains a high amount of butter and it must be shaped quickly with cool hands. After baking, the Kipferl are very fragile and the baker must be very cautious when rolling them in the sugar and vanilla mixture while they are still hot from the oven.\n\nSee also\nAustrian cuisine\nHungarian cuisine\nKifli\nCroissant\nCronut\nKue putri salju\nList of almond dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nVanillekipferl",

It typically consists of white potatoes that have been cut into 2-centimeter (0.79 in)-wide cubes, then fried in oil and served warm with a spicy \"brava\" sauce. \nVisitors to Spain often confuse it with the similar dish patatas mixtas, which consists of fried potatoes served with both brava sauce and aioli sauce. The brava sauce is primarily paprika (using high-quality Spanish piment\u00f3n de la Vera) and olive oil based,  with some regions adding tomato, although this can be contentious.\nThe dish is commonly served in restaurants and bars throughout Spain as a variety of tapa.\n\nConsumption\nPatatas bravas are served in bars in servings that contain approximately a quarter kilo of potato.  It is frequently consumed as part of tapas.\nThe same \"sauce\" is sometimes served over mussels. This dish is known as mejillones en salsa brava.\n\nSee also\nFrench fries\nPotato chip\nPapas arrugadas\nList of potato dishes\nPatatas a lo pobre\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Patrode/Patrodo/Patra/Patrodu is originally a vegetarian dish from India. It is also known as Rikvach in Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, Patrod\u00e9 in Karnataka, Patra in Gujarat, Chembila Appam in Kerala, Alu Vadi in Maharashtra (especially in Malvan) and Goa, Patrodu in Himachal Pradesh, Saina in Fiji, and Saheena in Trinidad and Tobago. It is a primary cuisine for the Konkani-speaking Gaud Saraswat Brahmin community (Patrodu). It is made from colocasia leaves (chevu in Tulu, taro, kesuve or arbi) stuffed with gram or rice flour and flavourings such as spices, tamarind, and jaggery (raw sugar).Patra in Sanskrit and its derivative languages means leaf and vade/vado means dumpling. In Maharashtra, it is also called Alu Vadi.In July 2021, it was identified as one of the traditional food recipes from the AYUSH system of medicine by the Union Ministry of AYUSH. According to the Ministry of AYUSH, iron-rich colocasia leaves help to improve hemoglobin levels. The leaves contain phenols, tannins, flavonoids, glycosides, and sterols, which help in reducing chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis. The leaves have significant amounts of vitamin C and beta-carotene.Care must be taken during preparation to ensure that the leaves are adequately cooked. Colocasia esculenta is a member of the Araceae group of plants (including caladium, philodendron, anthurium, alocasia, peace lily, etc.), which are all known to contain irritating calcium oxalate crystals. Only through proper duration of steaming/cooking are they palatable. Mild side effects are described as feeling similar to \u201cswallowing sand\u201d or having \u201ca mouthful of glass\u201d, sensations which can be accompanied by nausea, side aches and potential kidney stone formation, in the worst-case scenarios. Many other plants with thick, glossy foliage contain these same oxalate crystals as a natural defense against animals, albeit in varying concentrations, such as Swiss chard, and there are no issues for the consumer. The vast majority of people do not suffer from any issues, as most chefs prepare the taro leaves correctly.\n\nOrigin\nPatrode is originally a unique Himachal dish made from colocasia leaves. Over time this dish has been adopted by various states in India.\n\nSee also\nList of steamed foods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A pizza puff is a deep-fried dough pocket filled with cheese, tomato sauce, and other pizza ingredients such as sausage or pepperoni. Originally from Chicago, pizza puffs can be found at many casual dining restaurants there.Pizza puffs are similar to panzerotti. They are also somewhat like calzones, but calzones are baked instead of fried, and do not always include tomato sauce.Some Italian restaurants and casual dining establishments make their own pizza puffs from scratch. These pizza puffs feature a pizza dough wrapper, and tend to be somewhat larger than the pre-made ones.\n\nCommercial varieties\nSome hot dog stands in the Chicago area serve mass-produced pizza puffs that they purchase from the Iltaco company.  The frozen pizza puffs are deep-fried before serving.  The dough wrapper of these pizza puffs is similar to a flour tortilla.  Iltaco was founded in 1927 and was originally called the Illinois Tamale Company (\"Il-Ta-Co\"). It has been suggested that Iltaco invented the pizza puff. Iltaco pizza puffs are also sold in the frozen food section of some local area grocery stores.Arco Frozen Foods is another company that mass-produced pizza puffs, and introduced a retail pizza puff circa 1968.\n\nSee also\nList of deep fried foods\nPanzerotti\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Pone is a type of baked or fried bread in American cuisine, and the Cuisine of the Southern United States.  Pone could be made with corn, or some other main ingredient could be used like sweet potato. This style of  bread, eaten cold as a breakfast food, was a staple food of the cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies.\n\nTerminology\nThe term \"pone\" most likely entered English from Native American language terms like apan, oppone or supawn, meaning baked, possibly related to earlier ash cakes baked in hot coals. A \"corn pone\" is usually a small round loaf of cornbread, about the size of a biscuit, traditionally baked in a round cast iron skillet.The batter was also called \"corn pone\" and could be thin and fried on the griddle to make Johnny cakes or thicker to make baked loaves (\"pone\"), or dumplings, called corn dodgers when dropped in stews and hush puppies when  deep fried. Hush puppies were called \"fried pones\" in the 1928 edition of Southern Cooking by Henrietta Stanley Dull, later changed to \"hush puppy\" for the 1941 edition.Isabel Ely Lord uses the terms ash bread, johnny cake, spider cornbread and hoe cake as synonyms for corn pone. Her explanation of the history of these  different terms follows:\n\nAs \"ash bread\" it was baked in the hot ashes of the fireplace, protected by a cabbage leaf, or leaves; as \"hoe cake\" it baked on a hoe in the fields, or on a hoe-shaped board (with long handle) in the fireplace. \"Pone\" is the irregular oval shape the cakes took in these last 2 methods when shaped by the palm of the hand. \"Johnny cake\" was a Northern name, and the cake was usually baked in the oven.\n\nVariations\nThere are varieties on the basic corn pone recipe like apple pones, pumpkin pones and sweet potato pone. The batter can be enriched with sweeteners like sugar or molasses to improve the flavor, and spices like cinnamon, cloves, ginger or grated orange peel, but some cooks consider the addition of sugar a deviation from \"the original dish\". When milk is used in place of water it becomes corn cake.There are hundreds of variations of sweet potato pone in historical cookbooks with rose water, orange blossom water as a dessert, or served as a side dish for pork or wild game. Creole variations typically add black pepper.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Popcorn shrimp is the name of several small shrimp fritter dishes, so called because they are finger foods eaten like popcorn.In 1974, the American restaurant chain Red Lobster introduced a menu item called \"popcorn shrimp\", a fritter of small shrimp meat, which they still offer as of 2021.Other restaurants were also serving menu items named \"popcorn shrimp\" as early as 1975.In 1986, General Mills, the owner of Red Lobster at the time, applied to register the trademark \"popcorn shrimp\" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating they had been using it since 1977. It took two years to be granted, but then General Mills cancelled it the following year.Some sources suggest that popcorn shrimp originated as a Louisiana cuisine, and chef Paul Prudhomme made it famous. However, at least for the name, what Prudhomme invented was Cajun popcorn, which he put on the menu of the restaurant he worked, sometime later than 1975. Prudhomme published a recipe of Cajun popcorn in his cookbook in 1984. It is fritter of crayfish, made by dipping peeled crayfish tails in a batter of eggs, milk, corn flour, wheat flour, and spices, then deep-fryed, and served with sherry wine sauce. He added that shrimps can be used as a substitute for crayfish. Eventually, \"popcorn shrimp\" became associated with Prudhomme. Apart from names, neither Red Lobster's home page nor Prudhomme's book mention the origin of their dishes.\nToday as of 2021 in the US, the words \"popcorn shrimp\" has no live trademark registration for foods, and over 20 companies sell packaged foods by that name.Variations of popcorn shrimp span from heavily breaded styles, to light tempura-style.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nFried shrimp\nList of shrimp dishes\nPopcorn chicken: small, bite-sized pieces of breaded fried chicken",

        "body": "Rolled oyster is a baseball-sized seafood dish that is found only in and around Louisville, Kentucky. It consists of three raw oysters dipped in an egg-milk cornmeal batter called pastinga, rolled in cracker crumbs (hence the name), and deep fried. They were first served by Italian immigrant Phillip Mazzoni and his brothers in the late 19th century as a free giveaway to their saloon patrons with a purchased beer or whiskey. It is unknown if rolled oysters were actually invented by the Mazzonis, or if the recipe was brought over from Italy with them. During prohibition, Mazzoni's remained open by selling these oysters in their new restaurant and it became a popular food item all over town.  Today, most seafood restaurants and fish fries in the Louisville area will have their own version of these on their menus. Home Run Burgers and Fries had a version that was very popular as well.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Kentucky\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A Scotch egg is a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs and baked or deep-fried.\n\nOrigin\nVarious origin stories exist. The Oxford Companion to Food gives the first instance of the name as of 1809, in an edition of Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery. They did not, at that time, have a breadcrumb layer, although by 1861 Isabella Beeton suggested this as an option. According to the Oxford Companion to Food, food historian Annette Hope speculated in 1987 that the inspiration may have been Indian koftas such as the Mughlai dish called nargisi kofta (\"Narcissus meatballs\"), in which a boiled egg is encased in a seasoned ground-meat mixture and then fried.Other claims include the item having been invented at Fortnums. According to Culinary Delights of Yorkshire, they originated in Whitby, Yorkshire, England, in the 19th century, and were originally covered in fish paste rather than sausage meat. They were supposedly named after William J. Scott & Sons, a well-known eatery which sold them.It has also been suggested that they were originally called \"scorch\" eggs, as they were cooked over an open flame, though according to surviving recipes they were deep-fried in lard. 'Scotching' as a culinary process is also sometimes cited as the origin, though what 'scotching' was is open to interpretation, from the inclusion of anchovies to simply mincing meat. Further confusion is added by the large trade in eggs from Scotland in the 19th century, which sometimes involved dipping eggs in a lime powder to preserve them, a process possibly also known as 'scotching'.\n\nPreparation and serving\nScotch eggs are prepared by hard- or soft-boiling an egg, wrapping it in sausage meat, and deep-frying it. It is often eaten in pubs or as a cold snack at picnics.In the Netherlands and Belgium, Scotch eggs may also be called vogelnestje (\"little bird's nest\"), because they contain an egg. One 1880s Scottish recipe also calls them birds' nests.\n\nRegional variation\nThe Manchester egg consists of a pickled egg wrapped in a mixture of pork meat and Lancashire black pudding.Vegetarian versions have also been made.  In 2022, Guinness World Records certified a 18.341 kilograms (40.43 lb) vegetarian scotch egg as the world's largest.  It used an ostrich egg in the center, with a coating made of peas and cheddar cheese.  The Harwood Arms, a Michelin-starred restaurant in London, started selling a vegetarian scotch egg that uses a plant-based meat alternative in 2020, and the next year, the supermarket chain Tesco started selling a vegan version.\n\nNutrition\nA fatty food, a typical sausage-coated Scotch egg has about 200 mg dietary cholesterol per 100 grams.\n\nSee also\nDeep fried eggFarsu magruKwek-kwek, battered hard-boiled eggs popular as street food in the PhilippinesMeatloaf\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "body": "A Marie biscuit is a type of biscuit similar to a rich tea biscuit. It is also known (in various languages) as Mar\u00eda, Mariebon and Marietta, amongst other names.\n\nDescription\nThe biscuit is round and usually has the name embossed upon its top surface, the edges of which are also embossed with an intricate design. It is made with wheat flour, sugar, palm oil or sunflower seed oil and, unlike the rich tea biscuit, is typically vanilla-flavoured.\n\nHistory\nThe Marie biscuit was created by the London bakery Peek Freans in 1874 to commemorate the marriage of the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia to the Duke of Edinburgh. It became popular throughout Europe, particularly in Portugal and Spain where, following the Civil War, the biscuit became a symbol of the country's economic recovery after bakeries produced mass quantities to consume a surplus of wheat.\nMarie biscuits became popular in South Africa after going into production by Bakers Biscuits in 1898.\n\nConsumption\nMany consider that the plain flavour of Maries makes them, like rich tea biscuits, particularly suitable for dunking in tea. Other popular methods of consuming the biscuit include using two to make a sandwich with butter and Marmite or condensed milk spread in between; covering it with golden syrup; or crumbling it up in custard and jelly (gelatin dessert). Marie biscuits are also a common ingredient in home-baking recipes.\n\nIn Spain, natillas custard is typically served with a Maria biscuit on top.  In Uruguay, they are served filled with dulce de leche and sprinkled with shredded coconut. In Brazil, they are soaked in milk and then stacked in layers of chocolate and vanilla-flavoured custard cream, with whipped cream and crushed cashew nuts on top to make pav\u00ea, a popular Brazilian dessert. In Ireland, the biscuits are known as Marietta and manufactured by Jacob's. In Malaysia, people use them mainly for making batik cake. In India, they are commonly eaten plain with tea or sold in bakeries after coating with chocolate and wrapped in foil.\n\nManufacturers\nThe major international manufacturers (initially sorted by country name):\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBiscuit of the Week, a review at Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down\nReview of Maria Cookies, reviews of various international brands\nPhotos of Marie biscuits from various countries",

        "body": "Sesame chicken is a dish commonly found in Chinese restaurants throughout the United States and Canada. The dish is similar to General Tso's chicken but the taste of the Chinese-based chicken is sweet rather than spicy.\n\nDescription\nThe dish involves chicken (usually thigh) pieces that are de-boned, battered and Chinese deep-fried, then dressed with a translucent, reddish-brown, semi-thick, somewhat sweet sauce made from corn starch, vinegar, wine or sake, chicken broth and sugar, the last of which is a major contributor to sesame chicken's relative sweetness. After these preparations, the unfinished dish is topped with small sesame seeds, which may or may not be toasted, hence the name sesame chicken. It is sometimes, but not always, served with vegetables such as broccoli and baby corn.\n\nVariations\nSesame shrimp is also a popular variation of sesame chicken. Shrimp is simply substituted for chicken. Preparation of this dish is the same, with the exception of the degree and length of heating of the meat. Some restaurants serve sesame tofu.  \nAnother potential difference is that chopped almonds may be substituted for the sesame seeds, hence the name almond shrimp.\n\nSee also\nList of chicken dishes\nList of sesame seed dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRestaurant-style Chinese Sesame Chicken\nRecipe for \"Flawless\" Chinese Sesame Seed Chicken\nSesame Chicken - Chinese Chicken Recipes\nChinese-style Sesame Chicken Recipe\nBest Chinese Sesame Chicken in Alaska\nChinese-Style Sesame Chicken: A Delightful Blend of Flavors and Textures",

        "body": "Sev is a popular Indian snack food consisting of small pieces of crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste, which are seasoned with turmeric, cayenne, and ajwain before being deep-fried in oil. These noodles vary in thickness. Ready-to-eat varieties of sev, including flavoured sev, are available in Indian stores.Sev is eaten as a standalone snack and is also sprinkled as a topping on dishes like bhelpuri and sevpuri. Sev can be made at home and stored for weeks in airtight containers.Sev is a popular snack in India with several regional variations, particularly for chaat snacks in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where it is eaten topped with sweetened boondi.

Sorullos are served as a side dish or as appetizers (commonly known by the diminutive form sorullitos), and are sometimes stuffed with cheese. They can be served with mayoketchup, coffee or dusted in confectioners' sugar.\n\nDescription\nSorullo are made of a mix of steamed water or milk, sugar, salt, butter, and cornmeal; formed as sticks or logs, then fried. Alternatively, it can be shaped as a disk instead; in this case they are called \"tortitas de ma\u00edz\"(corn fritters). The flavor is usually lightly sweet but can also be savory. Sorullos are best served hot, and the texture is crisp on the outside and dense and soft in the inside.\n\nVarieties\n\"Sorullos de guayaba y queso\" are filled with guava and cream cheese or queso blanco.\nSorullos can also be stuffed with cheese. American cheese slices, Edam cheese (known as queso de bola), cheddar cheese (known as queso de papa), and mozzarella are the most popular for stuffing. Manchego, parmesan, and montebello (a local cheese) can be grated into the corn dough.\nThere are also recipes containing bits of corn kernels, coconut milk (known as sorullos de coco), and green or yellow boiled mashed plantains added. (Known as sorullos de Pl\u00e1tano).\n\nServing\nSorullitos are found throughout Puerto Rico. They are considered a side dish, usually served alone as a snack with guava sauce, mayo-ketchup or as a  French fry substitute for burgers and sandwiches. They can also be served with coffee in which they are dunked.\n\nSee also\nPuerto Rican cuisine\nHushpuppy\nLumpiang keso\nMozzarella sticks\nTeque\u00f1os\nList of maize dishes\nList of stuffed dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSorullos recipe",

The flavours are creamy with mushroom and nutty aftertastes but vary depending on maturity of cheese. Gubbeen Farmhouse Products also produce a Smoked Gubbeen.\nGubbeen Cheese has been produced since 1979 by Tom and Giana Ferguson at the 100 hectares (250 acres) Gubbeen Farm in Schull, County Cork. The name \"Gubbeen\" is an anglicisation of the Irish word goib\u00edn which means a small beak or mouth and is taken from the name of the townland the farm is in.All milk used for the cheese comes from their own herd of dairy cows, which is a mixture of several breeds; British Friesian, Simmenthal, Jersey, and Kerry.  The milk is stored in vats to which starter culture and rennet are added, causing the milk to set. This is then cut and stirred until the curds develop. The cheese is developed in curing rooms where the rind is washed daily. This is an important part of the process as the washing gives rise to the distinctive surface bloom and develops the characteristic flavours. The cheese develops deeper flavours as it matures.In 2001, a new strain of lactic acid producing bacteria, Microbacterium gubbeenense, was named after a study into the smear-ripening of Gubbeen cheese.Each cheese is 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter, 5 cm (2.0 in) in height, weighs 1,200 g (42 oz) and has a fat content of 48%. The cheese is also available as a mini-truckle weighing 400 g.\n\nAwards\nGubbeen cheese has been the recipient of numerous awards, both nationally and internationally.  Here is a selection of some recent awards:\n\n2011 Silver Medal in the Irish Cheese Awards for semi-soft cheese\n2010 Gold Medal at the British Cheese Awards for semi-soft cheese\n2016 Gold Medal at the British Cheese Awards for Rind washed cheese\n2016  Gold Medal at the British Cheese Awards for Mature smoked Gubbeen\n\nSee also\nList of Irish cheeses\nList of smoked foods\n Food portal\n\n\n== References ==",

Forman & Son is a salmon smokery located (in a building shaped like a piece of salmon) in Fish Island, London, England run by former Brexit Party MEP and Conservative Party MEP, Lance Forman (birth name: Lance Anisfeld).\n\nLondon Cure Smoked Salmon\nH. Forman & Son produces \"London Cure Smoked Salmon\", which is protected under the EU Protected Geographical Indication scheme. The application for protected status was submitted by Lance Forman and was supported by then Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who opened the factory in 2009. It is the first London-based food to obtain this EU protected status.The designation provides protected name status to products under EU law, allowing the London Cure Smoked Salmon to be labelled and protected with an EU trade mark. Forman stated he was \"very proud\" of the designation, but later dismissed the idea the EU has advanced H. Forman & Son, telling Salmon Business \u201cI can honestly say that having been in the EU hasn\u2019t created any serious commercial advantages for our business\".The London Cure Smoked Salmon has featured on the menus of the dining rooms in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons and has also been sold in Harrods, Selfridges and Fortnum & Mason.\n\nPublic relations\nFollowing a lengthy dispute, the site of the business was relocated in 2007 from the area which is now the London Olympic Park as part a compulsory purchase order by the London Development Agency (LDA) involving more than 200 companies for the London 2012 Olympics. The cost of relocation to its current premises - a building shaped like a piece of salmon, with a roof resembling salmon skin - was shared between the company and the LDA.The business faced threats of a local boycott in the wake of Lance Forman's election as a London MEP for the Brexit Party, a group which won only 6% of votes locally in the May 2019 European Parliament elections. Police investigations were opened in the run-up to the elections after a 10-metre swastika was spray-painted on the side of the business in a suspected anti-semitic attack. Forman claimed that he did not believe his business was targeted due to his Jewish heritage but rather because he supported Brexit.In November 2019, the business was publicly criticised by the mayors of Tower Hamlets and Hackney for hosting a public meeting of Turning Point UK (the British incarnation of Turning Point USA, a controversial, right-wing, pro-Trump organisation). Lance Forman, owner of the business, who was also on a panel at the meeting, defended the decision saying he was in favour of free speech.\n\nFDA rulings\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  issued a FDA warning letter to Formans' on 12 May 2020; the FDA accepted the company was in compliance on 29 September 2020.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Gochujang (Korean: \uace0\ucd94\uc7a5; Korean pronunciation: [kot\u0255\u02b0ud\u0291\u0251\u014b]) or red chili paste is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented condiment popular in Korean cooking. It is made from gochu-garu (chili powder), glutinous rice, meju (fermented soybean) powder, yeotgireum (barley malt powder), and salt. The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process. Traditionally, it would be naturally fermented over years in jangdok (earthenware) on an elevated stone platform called jangdokdae in the backyard.\nThe Sunchang Gochujang Festival is held annually in Gochujang Village in Sunchang County, North Jeolla Province, South Korea.\n\nHistory\nIt has commonly been assumed that spicy jang (\uc7a5; \u82e6\u6912\u91ac) varieties were made using black peppers and chopi (Japanese pepper) before the introduction of chili peppers. Shiyi xinjian (\u98df\u91ab\u5fc3\u9451), a mid-9th century Chinese document, recorded the Korean pepper paste as \u82e6\u6912\u91ac (lit.\u2009'pepper paste'). The second-oldest documentation of pepper paste is found in the 1433 Korean book Collected Prescriptions of Native Korean Medicines. Pepper paste is again mentioned in a 1445 medical encyclopedia named Compendia of Medical Prescriptions.Chili peppers, which originated in the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders in the early 16th century. The first mention of chili pepper in Korea is found in Collected Essays of Jibong, an encyclopedia published in 1614. Farm Management, a book from ca. 1700, discussed the cultivation methods of chili peppers.In the 18th-century books, Somun saseol (\uc18c\ubb38\uc0ac\uc124; \u8b0f\u805e\u4e8b\u8aaa) and Revised and Augmented Farm Management, gochujang is written as gochojang, using hanja characters \u82e6\u6912\u91ac and \u53e4\u6912\u91ac. It is also mentioned that Sunchang County was renowned for its gochujang production. China and Japan, the countries with which Korea has historically shared the most culture and trade, do not include gochujang in their traditional cuisines.\n\nHistorical recipes\nGochujang ingredients reported in Jeungbo sallim gyeongje were 18 litres (19 US quarts) of powdered and sieved meju (fermented soybeans), 540 mL (18+1\u20442 US fl oz) of chili powder, and 1.8 L (1+7\u20448 U.S. qt) of glutinous rice flour, as well as soup soy sauce for adjusting the consistency. The gochujang recipe in Gyuhap chongseo, an 1809 cookbook, uses powdered meju made from 18 L (19 US qt) of soybeans and 3.6 L (3+3\u20444 US qt) of glutinous rice, then adding 900\u20131,260 mL (30+1\u20442\u201342+1\u20442 US fl oz) of chili powder and bap made from 3.6 L (3.8 US qt) of glutinous rice.\n\nIngredients\nGochujang's primary ingredients are red chili powder (\uace0\ucd94\uac00\ub8e8; gochugaru), glutinous rice powder, powdered fermented soybeans, and salt. Korean chili peppers, of the species Capsicum annuum, are spicy yet sweet making them ideal for gochujang production.\nOther recipes use glutinous rice (\ucc39\uc300; chapssal), normal short-grain rice (\ub9f5\uc300; mepssal), or barley. Less common additions include whole wheat kernels, jujubes, pumpkin, and sweet potato. A small amount of sweetener, such as sugar, syrup, or honey, is also sometimes added. The finished product is a dark, reddish paste with a rich, piquant flavor.\nThe making of gochujang at home began tapering off when commercial production came into the mass market in the early 1970s. Now, most Koreans purchase gochujang at grocery stores or markets. It is still used extensively in Korean cooking to flavor stews (jjigae), such as in gochujang jjigae; to marinate meat, such as in gochujang bulgogi; and as a condiment for naengmyeon and bibimbap.\nGochujang is also used as a base for making other condiments, such as chogochujang (\ucd08\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5) and ssamjang (\uc308\uc7a5). Chogochujang is a variant of gochujang made by adding vinegar and other seasonings, such as sugar and sesame seeds. It is usually used as a sauce for hoe and hoedeopbap. Similarly, ssamjang is a mixture of mainly gochujang and doenjang, with chopped onions and other spicy seasonings, and it is popular with sangchussam (\uc0c1\ucd94\uc308).\n\nGochujang hot-taste unit\nGochujang hot-taste unit (GHU) is a unit of measurement for the pungency (spicy heat) of gochujang, based on the gas chromatography and the high-performance liquid chromatography of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin concentrations.Gochujang products are assigned to one of the five levels of spiciness: Mild, Slight Hot, Medium Hot, Very Hot, and Extreme Hot.\n\nUses\nGochujang is used in various dishes such as bibimbap and tteokbokki, and in salads, stews, soups, and marinated meat dishes. Gochujang may make dishes spicier (depending on the capsaicin in the base chili), but also can make dishes sweeter and smokier.\n\nFurther reading\nErin Craig (19 Aug 2020). \"Gochujang: The trendy Korean food that burns\".

The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.\nGenerally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at b\u014dnenkai, Japanese year-end parties.\n\nIngredients\nThinly sliced beef is usually used for sukiyaki, although in the past, in certain parts of the country (notably Hokkaid\u014d and Niigata) pork was also popular.\nPopular ingredients cooked with the beef are:\n\nTofu (usually seared firm tofu).\nNegi (a type of scallion).\nLeafy vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and shungiku (garland chrysanthemum leaves).\nMushrooms such as shiitake and enokitake.\nGlass noodles made out of konnyaku or corm such as ito konnyaku or shirataki noodles.Boiled wheat udon or mochi (rice-cakes) are sometimes added, usually at the end to soak up the broth.\n\nPreparation\nSukiyaki is a one-pot dish (nabemono) that was developed during the Meiji era. Different regions have different ways of preparing sukiyaki. There are two main styles, the Kanto style from eastern Japan and Kansai style from western Japan.\nIn the Kanto style, warishita (a mixture of sake, soy sauce, sugar, mirin and dashi) is poured and heated in a pot, then meat, vegetables and other ingredients are added and simmered together. In Kansai-style sukiyaki, meat is heated in the pot first. When the meat is almost cooked, sugar, sake and soy sauce are added, then vegetables and other ingredients are added last.\nThe vegetables and meat used are different between the two styles. Because beef was expensive in the past, the use of pork was common in northern and eastern regions. Other ingredients added to modern sukiyaki include chicken (tori-suki), fish (uo-suki or oki-suki), udon noodles (udon-suki), negi, shiitake mushrooms, shirataki and slightly grilled tofu. In both styles, raw eggs are used as a dipping sauce and steamed rice with black sesame seeds is served.\n\nHistory\nThere are various traditions about sukiyaki. Some concern the name. A theory about the origin of the name is from the word suki (\u92e4), which means spade, and yaki (\u713c\u304d) which is the verb to grill. During the Edo period (1603\u20131868), farmers used  suki to cook things like fish and tofu. However, sukiyaki became a traditional Japanese dish during the Meiji era (1868\u20131912). Another theory is that the name comes from the word sukimi (\u5265\u304d\u8eab), which means \"thinly sliced meat\".Another tradition concerns the history of sukiyaki. Buddhism was introduced to Japan during the Asuka period. At that time, killing animals was against Buddhist law. Also eating beef was prohibited since cattle were considered work animals. However, people could eat meat under some special circumstances such as when they were sick or at special events like b\u014dnenkai, the year-end drinking party. During the Edo period eating game such as boar and duck was common and not forbidden. In the 1860s, when Japan opened its ports to foreign merchants, foreigners who came to Japan introduced the culture of eating meat and new cooking styles. Cows, milk, meat, and eggs became widely used, and sukiyaki was a popular way to serve them. At first, cattle were imported from neighboring countries like Sukiyaki possibly originated and became popular in the Kansai region. Following the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, many beef restaurants in Tokyo were closed and many people in Kant\u014d temporarily moved to the Osaka area.  While the people of Kant\u014d were in Osaka, they got accustomed to the Kansai style of sukiyaki, and when they returned to Kant\u014d, they introduced the Kansai sukiyaki style, where it has since become popular. Beef is the primary ingredient in today's sukiyaki.Sukiyaki became prominent in U.S. Japanese restaurants by the 1930s. In 1978 W.L. Taitte stated in Texas Monthly that sukiyaki was \"the most famous but hardly the most characteristic Japanese dish.\" By the 1980s, in the U.S., sukiyaki was becoming obscure as sushi became more prominent.\n\nTrivia\nThe 1961 song \"Ue wo Muite Aruk\u014d\" was given the alternative title \"Sukiyaki\" so that it could be short and recognizably Japanese in English-speaking countries alike. Despite the title, the lyrics have no connection to sukiyaki.Swedish comedian and singer Povel Ramel wrote a song, the \"Sukiyaki Syndrome\", wherein the restaurant customer wants Sukiyaki. There are a number of variations, each with a long description, so long that by the time he orders any of them, the restaurant has run out.\n\nRelated dishes\nShabu-shabu is similar, but whereas sukiyaki is considered sweeter, shabu-shabu is more savory. Shabu-shabu meat is even more thinly sliced and the individual slices of meat are cooked by dipping into simmering liquid at the table, while sukiyaki is cooked in a more casserole style.\nSukiyaki in Laos takes the form of a bowl of bean thread noodles, various vegetables, thinly sliced beef and other meats or seafood, sukiyaki sauce, and a raw egg in beef broth. The sukiyaki sauce is made from coconut, fermented tofu, tahini, peanut butter, sugar, garlic, lime, and spices.\nThai suki or Thai sukiyaki is a very popular hot pot dish in Thailand and, increasingly, neighboring countries.  Despite the name, it bears only a vague resemblance to Japanese sukiyaki.\nHot pot\nFondue Bourguignonne and fondue chinoise\n\nSee also\nList of Japanese soups and stews\nGyudon\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n\nA Taste of Japan, Donald Richie, Kodansha, 2001.

        "body": "Sabra Dipping Company, LLC is a U.S.-based company which produces Middle Eastern-style and other food products, including hummus and guacamole. It is co-owned by PepsiCo and the Strauss Group. All Sabra products are certified kosher and vegetarian, and are available throughout the U.S. and Canada. As of 2016, the company held a 60% market share for hummus sales in the United States, and was forecast to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2017.\n\nGrowth\nThe company was founded in 1986 by Zohar Norman and Yehuda Pearl as Sabra-Blue & White Foods. The company was bought in 2005 by Israeli food manufacturer Strauss. Prior to the acquisition by Strauss, Sabra had entered into negotiations to purchase Basha hummus, which was then the leading hummus brand in Detroit. However, the deal never closed successfully, languishing for months until it became clear that Strauss was not interested in acquiring Basha.In March 2008, Strauss entered a joint-venture partnership with Frito-Lay, a division of the multinational PepsiCo corporation. Strauss owns 50% and PepsiCo 50% of the company. In November 2008, the company announced the construction of a new $61 million plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia, expected to employ 260 people and come on line in mid-2010. The company grew over 50% between August 2008 and August 2009.By 2016, Sabra had gained a 60% market share of hummus in the United States, and, through its co-ownership and sales channels with PepsiCo, was close to $1 billion in annual sales. To parallel the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers have increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than 100 million pounds (45,000 metric tons) in 2015, up from about 25 million pounds (11,000 metric tons) in 2009.\n\nMarketing\nDuring the run-up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Sabra commissioned sculptor Kirk Rademaker to create busts of candidates John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton out of 100 pounds of hummus.Sabra launched its first U.S. national advertising campaign in March 2009, with the StrawberryFrog ad agency. In May 2009, the company began a series of promotional events in which it recreated \"Mediterranean villages\" in 11 major U.S. cities. By 2015, Sabra had established greater presence among American and Canadian consumers by marketing a \"cultural movement\" based on a desire for people to experience hummus as an old world food with new tastes close to what they already knew.\n\nBoycott campaigns\nUntil 2010, the Strauss Group stated on their English-language website that the company donated food packages to the Golani Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces. Activists in the BDS movement called for boycotts of Sabra products over the donations. Student groups at DePaul University, Princeton University, and the University of Ottawa campaigned unsuccessfully to have their schools switch to alternate brands. In 2019, the Dickinson College Student Senate passed a resolution endorsing a ban on Sabra Hummus.\n\nHummus recalls\nOn April 8, 2015, Sabra recalled 30,000 cases of its classic hummus after a tub in Michigan tested positive for Listeria. Inspectors with the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) learned of the possible contamination by L. monocytogenes after routine inspections on March 30 at a Kroger in Port Huron, according to MDARD spokeswoman Jennifer Holton.On November 19, 2016, Sabra voluntarily recalled multiple hummus varieties across the U.S. after Listeria was discovered at one of its manufacturing plants, though the company stated the bacteria had not been found in any of its actual products.In March 2021, Sabra recalled about 2,100 cases of 10 oz. Classic Hummus, following a routine inspection by the FDA in the US, due to a possible salmonella contamination. The recall affected sixteen different states in the US.\n\nSee also\nList of vegetarian and vegan companies\nSabra (person)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "body": "Xuixo (Catalan pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0283u\u0283u]; also known as xuxo; Spanish: suso) is a viennoiserie pastry from the city of Girona in Catalonia, Spain. It is a deep-fried, sugar-coated cylindrical pastry filled with crema catalana.Commonly eaten for breakfast or tea, it is honored as Producte de la Terra (English: Product of the home country) by the Department of Agriculture, Farming and Fishing of the Government of Catalonia.\nIt is assumed that this pastry originated in 1920s Girona in a pastry shop owned by Emili Puig in the Street Cort Reial. A French pastry shop showed Puig the preparation of cream-filled pastry and this inspired him to create the Xuixo.\nThis pastry is very popular not only in Girona but has been also accepted in the surrounding areas and can also be found in Tarragona, Castell\u00f3n de la Plana and Valencia.\nIn the second half of the 20th century it was one of the most demanded product in the Xurreries (pastry shops, Spanish: churrer\u00edas) and nowadays it is commercialized by a candy brand that sells them not plain but with a chocolate icing.\n\nThe legend\nAccording to a legend in Girona the invention of the Xuixo has to be credited to el Tarl\u00e0, a very sympathetic person that is very present in the legends of this area. This acrobat that entertained the citizens in a quarantine during an epidemic, fell in love with the daughter of a pastry chef. Once when he visited his beloved girl her father appeared and he hid in a bag of flour. Unfortunately he sneezed (which sounds like xui-xui) and was discovered. Before the pastry chef could get angry he promised to marry his daughter and give him the recipe of a special pastry: the Xuixo. He named it after the sneeze that betrayed him.\nNowadays a figure of el Tarl\u00e0 can be seen every year during the spring festivities when its copy is erected at the place where he had entertained the people of Girona.\n\nThe popular Xuixo procession\nThe foundation \"Fundaci\u00f3 Oncolliga Girona\" and the government of Girona organize the popular procession Marxa del Xuixo. It is a procession in which the whole family participates and strolls through the streets of Girona to discover the city's natural surroundings. After the walk the participants are given Xuixos that have been prepared by the board of pastry chefs of Girona.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLegend about the invention of Xuixo\nOriginating\nFried Pastry Filled with Cream",

The dish originates from Sichuan, China.\n\nPreparation\nYin yang fish is prepared by wrapping the head of a scaled fish (usually carp) in ice cubes and then oil-frying it whole. The fish is then covered in sauce and served on a plate where its head continues to twitch even after its body has been cooked (likely due to remnant electrical impulses after death).\n\nControversy\nIn 2007, a Taiwanese restaurant owner sparked outrage when he began serving the dish in his restaurant in Chiayi, Taiwan, with a city official and members of the public criticizing the cruelty of the dish.

It is similar to Viennese schnitzel or Italian cotoletta, French c\u00f4telette de veau frite (or c\u00f4telette Menon), and North and South American milanesa.\nThe history of schabowy dates back to the 19th century. Different recipes for cutlets such as schabowy are featured in an 1860 cookbook by Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa, 365 obiad\u00f3w za pi\u0119\u0107 z\u0142otych (365 Dinners for Five Z\u0142oty), but are missing from the 1786 cookbook by Wojciech Wiel\u0105dek called Kucharz doskona\u0142y (The Perfect Chef),  suggesting that the dish was not known (or at least not popular) before the 19th century. Typical ingredients include eggs, lard or oil, spices, pork loin with or without the bone, breadcrumbs and flour.\nPork tenderloin is cut into one-inch slices and pounded with a mallet until it becomes thinner and soft. It is marinated in milk and onions. The meat is dipped in flour, then in egg, and then covered in breadcrumbs. Oil or lard is heated in a frying pan until it starts to sizzle and the meat is placed onto it, then turned over a couple of times. Kotlet schabowy can be served with cooked potatoes, mashed potatoes, fried mushrooms, cooked vegetables (seared cabbage), salads or coleslaw.\n\nReferences\n\nEwa Czerniakowska, Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa.

        "body": "A fool is an English dessert. Traditionally, fruit fool is made by folding pur\u00e9ed stewed fruit (classically gooseberries) into sweet custard. Modern fool recipes often skip the traditional custard and use whipped cream. Additionally, a flavouring agent such as rose water may be added.\n\nEtymology\nWhy the word \"fool\" is used as the name of this fruit dessert is not clear. Several authors derive it from the French verb fouler meaning \"to crush\" or \"to press\" (in the context of pressing grapes for wine),  and Alan Davidson argues that it is 'reasonable to suppose that the idea of mashed fruit was there from the start' but also points out that Norfolk fool, contained no fruit. but this derivation is dismissed by the Oxford English Dictionary as baseless and inconsistent with the early use of the word. The name trifle was also originally applied to the dish, with the two names being used, for a time, interchangeably. In the late 16th century a trifle was 'a dish composed of cream boiled with various ingredients'. Davidson suggests that this is 'also the description one could give of a fool'. In support for this theory, Davidson quotes John Florio from his dictionary of 1598: 'a kinde of clouted cream called a fool or a trifle'.\n\nHistory\n'Foole' is first mentioned as a dessert in 1598, made of 'clouted creame' although the origins of gooseberry fool may date back to the 15th century. The earliest recipe for fruit fool dates to the mid-17th century. The soft fruits used in fools in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were often boiled and pulped before being mixed with the cream. It was considered the most 'prudent' way to eat fruit at the time as there was a fear that fruit was unhealthy and so it was felt necessary to boil fruit to a pulp to make it safe. Fruit fools and creams, argues food historian C. Anne Wilson, 'succeeded the medieval fruit pottages. They were based on the pulp of cooked fruits beaten together with cream and sugar. Gooseberries, and later orange juice combined with beaten eggs, were made up into fools.' The cream in earlier fools was often left unwhipped. The process of whipping cream before forks were adopted in the late 17th century was long and difficult. The eggs used in many earlier fool recipes became less common, and now most fools are made without them.\n\nVariations\nOriginally, the most common fruit ingredient in fools was gooseberries, although other fruits and berries are known from early recipes, e.g., apples, strawberries, rhubarb and raspberries. Modern recipes may include any seasonal fruit readily found. In Anglo-Indian cuisine, mango fool is a popular variation.Norfolk fool is an old local variation of the fruit fool, often containing minimal or no fruit. It is seasoned with spices, such as mace and cinnamon, and thickened with eggs and boiled. The original recipe can be found in The Accomplisht Cook by Robert May 1660:\n\nTo make a Norfolk Fool. Take a quart of good thick sweet cream, and set it a boiling in a clean scoured skillet, with some large mace and whole cinnamon; then having boil'd a warm or two take the yolks of five or six eggs dissolved and put to it, being taken from the fire, then take out the cinnamon and mace; the cream being pretty thick, slice a fine manchet into thin slices, as much as will cover the bottom of the dish, pour on the cream on them, and more bread, some two or three times till the dish be full, then trim the dish side with fine carved sippets, and stick it with slic't dates, scrape on sugar, and cast on red and white biskets.\n\nSee also\nCompote\nCr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nEton mess\nTrifle\nList of desserts\nList of fruit dishes\nPanna cotta\nPavlova (dessert)\nSmoothie\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Fool (dessert) at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "Curly fries are french fries cut into a spiral shape, typically seasoned with a distinct spice mix composed primarily of paprika, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Though they are sometimes said to have been invented by the Arby\u2019s restaurant chain, their actual origins are more complex.\n\nOrigins\nThe creation date of the curly fry has been pinpointed, but its existence can be traced back to the 19th century. Oklahoma City's Dolores Restaurant and Inn served curly fries as \"Suzi-Q potatoes\" in 1938.\nIn the 1980s, Washington company TaterBoy had the debut of the industrial \"Curley Fries\". The first company to produce curly fries in mass quantities is Simplot, which used the specific blend of spices that became popular. Arby's is well known for curly fries, but they did not introduce them until 1988. However, Arby's may have been the first company to utilize Cajun-style seasoning on their \"Curly-Q Fries\".\n\nPreparation\nConAgra Foods, the company which produces Arby's curly fries, uses powerful industrial machinery such as spiralisers to turn whole potatoes into the curly fry shape. The curly fry shape can also be produced with spiral scissors.  For the spiralisers, the potatoes are cleaned, then are propelled through a set of pipes at 60 miles per hour by water. In the pipes, the potatoes are held in place and sliced by rotating blades, producing a spiral that has been found to go over two and a half feet long when stretched out.\nThe fries are then blanched, dried, battered with a mixture with the seasoning inside, fried, frozen, and refried at the restaurant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Freedom fries was a politically motivated renaming of french fries in the United States. The term was created in February 2003 in a North Carolina restaurant, and was widely publicized a month later when the then Republican Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney, renamed the menu item in three Congressional cafeterias. The political renaming occurred in context of France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. Although some restaurants around the nation adopted the renaming, the term became unpopular, in part due to decreasing popularity of the Iraq War. After Ney's resignation as Chairman in 2006, the change of name in congressional cafeterias was reverted.\n\nBackground\nFrench opposition to the Iraq war\nAfter the September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda and the declaration of a \"War on Terror\" by President George W. Bush, an invasion of Iraq was proposed. During the United Nations Security Council deliberations, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin made it clear France would neither support nor participate in the invasion, and that it would veto any resolution that mandates an invasion of Iraq. Though Russia and China also opposed the invasion, they had not threatened to use their veto power on the Security Council; as such, France was perceived as the main barrier to the American and British effort to secure a UN mandate for invasion. This caused some Americans to accuse France of betrayal, reigniting prior anti-French sentiment in the United States.\n\nInitial renaming\nRenaming was initiated in February 2003 by Beaufort, North Carolina, \"Cubbie's\" restaurant owner Neal Rowland, who said he was motivated by similar actions against Germany in World War I, when \"sauerkraut was called liberty cabbage, and frankfurters were renamed hot dogs.\" (The term hot dog was in use well before the outbreak of World War I. In fact, sauerkraut was renamed victory cabbage and Frankfurters were renamed liberty dogs.)  In an interview about the name change, Rowland commented, \"since the French are backing down [from the war], French fries and French everything needs to be banned.\" In March 2007, Rowland obtained a trademark registration for the term \"freedom fries\", which was cancelled in November 2013.\n\nU.S. House adoption\nOn March 11, 2003, Republican U.S. Representatives Bob Ney and Walter B. Jones directed the three House cafeterias to change all references to French fries and French toast on menus, and replace them with Freedom fries and Freedom toast, respectively. Jones chose to follow Cubbie's example by circulating a letter to his colleagues advocating their renaming because, he said, \"the French were 'sitting on the sidelines.'\" As Ney was Chairman of the United States House Committee on House Administration, the action did not require any vote, as the committee has authority over House cafeterias. According to a statement released by Ney, the renaming was intended to express displeasure with France's \"continued refusal to stand with their U.S. allies.\" The statement further read: \"This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure many on Capitol Hill have with our so-called ally, France.\" When asked about his view on the change, Jones said it was a \"lighthearted gesture.\" This also came to apply to dining halls for the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq during the U.S. occupation of Iraq.\n\nReactions\nIn response to the change, French Embassy spokeswoman Nathalie Loiseau commented \"It's exactly a non-issue ... we focus on the serious issues\" and noted that fries originated in Belgium. She then remarked that France's position on the change was that they were \"in a very serious moment dealing with very serious issues, and we are not focusing on the name [Americans] give to potatoes.\" After the name reversal, an embassy spokeswoman said: \"our relations are definitely much more important than potatoes ... and our relations are back on track.\"In a 2005 opinion poll by Gallup, participants were asked if they felt the renaming of French fries and toast was \"a silly idea or a sincere expression of patriotism;\" 66% answered it was silly, 33% answered it was patriotic, and 1% had no opinion. However, only 15% of participants actually considered using the term \"freedom fries\"; 80% said they would continue to call them \"french fries\". Several restaurants followed the Houses' change. As of 2020, several American restaurants still used the name \"freedom fries\". Opposing the name change, The Saturn Cafe in Santa Cruz, California, changed their menu to \"Impeach George W. Bush fries.\" Meanwhile, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of French's mustard, were sufficiently concerned about the movement to publicly clarify that its brand derived from a family name.\nMassachusetts Democratic Congressman Barney Frank noted that the change made \"Congress look even sillier than it sometimes looks,\" New York Democratic Congressman Jos\u00e9 Serrano characterized the renaming as \"petty grandstanding,\" and urged fellow legislators to concentrate on more pressing issues.The French American indie band Freedom Fry chose their name based on the Freedom Fries phenomenon. In 2005, Robert Plant and his band Strange Sensation released the album Mighty ReArranger, which contains the track '\"Freedom Fries,\" an anti-war song whose lyrics contains the words \"Freedom fries and burns and scars, the liberator goes too far.\"\n\nPolicy reversal\nOn August 2, 2006, the House cafeteria menus were changed back without any announcement. The change was made by the new House Administration Committee Chairman, Vern Ehlers, who replaced Ney following his resignation due to a scandal. When asked about his decision, Ehlers responded, \"It's no big deal ... It's not news.\" When asked in 2005 about his opinion on the \"freedom fries\" episode, Walter B. Jones responded, \"I wish it had never happened.\"\n\nSee also\nFreedom pineapples\nStar Spangled Ice Cream\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"House restaurants change name of 'french fries' and 'french toast'\", CNN.com, March 11, 2003\nJohnny Depp on the Freedom Fries incident, \"U.S. is like a stupid puppy\", CNN.com, September 3, 2003",

        "body": "A pancake machine is an electrically-powered machine that automatically produces cooked pancakes. It is believed that the earliest known pancake machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of pancake machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce pancake machines, and some have been homemade.\n\nHistory\nIn 1928, a man in Portland, Oregon, invented an electric pancake machine that operated by the process of batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.In 1955 in the United States, an automatic pancake machine was developed by Vendo, which used a specially formulated pancake batter mix that was manufactured by the Quaker Oats Company's Aunt Jemima branch. The Vendo machine could produce pancakes \"in less than three minutes\". It was a semi-automatic machine that performed all of the cooking functions except for the pouring of the pancake batter.In 1956, four Racine, Wisconsin, engineers developed and fabricated two, 5' diameter gas burning pancake machines for the annual\nPancake Day sponsored by the Kiwanis Club there in Racine.\n\nTypes and uses\nVarious types of pancake machines exist, such as those that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.\n\nHomemade pancake machines\nHomemade versions of pancake machines have been constructed. An example of a homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which was used for the organization's annual pancake day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle. The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750\u20131000 pancakes per hour.\n\nCompanies and brands\nCommercial and home-consumer pancake machines are mass-produced by some companies in contemporary times.\n\nCommercial products\nCommercial pancake machines are typically used in the commercial foodservice and hospitality industries.Popcake is a pancake machine brand that can produce 200 pancakes per hour. Individual Pancakes are produced in seconds by this machine. The machine was designed for use in commercial establishments such as cafeterias and convenience stores.Popcake is an international company that produces Popcake-brand pancake machines. The Popcake machine was invented by Marek Szymanski in Australia, and as of July 2014 approximately 7,000 of them are used worldwide. This brand has features that allow users to adjust the size, quantity and doneness level of the pancakes produced. Plates of pancakes are produced in around two minutes time by the Popcake machine.\n\nConsumer products\nIn March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine received over $141,000 on Kickstarter. Its target donation request on the website was $50,000. PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed by the use of pancake batter in a bottle that is moved by a programmable machine arm atop the griddle. The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.\n\nNovelty machines\nIn commemoration of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine was built by The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine involves the use of a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.\n\nSee also\nFood processing\nFrench fries vending machine\nLet's Pizza\nList of cooking appliances\nWaffle iron\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Pancake machines at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "The Frietmuseum (Fries museum) is a museum in Bruges, Belgium, which is devoted to the history of potatoes and the production of Belgian fries. It describes itself as \"the first and only museum dedicated to potato fries\".\n\nHistory\nThe museum was founded in 2008 by Eddy Van Belle, who had previously opened two other museums in Bruges, both based in one building: Choco-Story, which is dedicated to Belgium's chocolate industry, and Lumina Domestica, which houses Van Belle's 6,500-piece collection of lamps. Inspired by the popularity of Choco-Story, Van Belle had researched the possibility of a museum dedicated to fries, and was encouraged to open the Frietmuseum after discovering that no similar museum existed elsewhere.\n\nDescription\nThe Frietmuseum is located in the Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall) at Vlamingstraat 33. This is one of the oldest buildings in the World Heritage listed historic centre of Bruges and dates back to 1399, with an annexe added shortly afterwards. Throughout the fifteenth century, this building was used as a base for the activities of Genoese merchants. Prior to the museum's opening, it underwent a year and a half of renovation work, including restoration of the fa\u00e7ade. During this work, no structural changes were made to the interior of the building.The museum is spread across three floors. Exhibits on the ground floor trace the history of potatoes, beginning in Peru c.8000BC. The first floor details the history of fries, and their origins in Belgium. The basement of the building houses a cafe. Exhibits include photographs, artwork, historical potato peelers and chip-making machines, and a video outlining how to make perfect fries.\n\nBuilding\nThe building is housed in the Gothic Saaihalle (former wool hall). The building dates back to 1399, was extended as the residence of the Consul of Genoa in 1441, used by weavers from 1578 to 1750, and has since served variously as an inn, caf\u00e9, cinema, dancehall, and since 1978 as a bank and exhibition space.\n\nSee also\nNational Heritage Site (Belgium)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in English)",

        "body": "Gouda cheese ( , US also  , Dutch: [\u02c8\u0263\u028cuda\u02d0] ; Dutch: Goudse kaas, \"cheese from Gouda\") is a creamy, yellow cow's milk cheese originating from the Netherlands. It is one of the most popular cheeses worldwide. The name is used today as a general term for numerous similar cheeses produced in the traditional Dutch manner.\n\nHistory\nThe first mention of Gouda cheese dates from 1184, making it the oldest recorded cheeses in the world still produced today with the same recipe. The cheese is named after the city of Gouda, South Holland, not because it was produced in or around that city, but because it was traded there. In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain certain feudal rights which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods. Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold. Teams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by distinct differently coloured straw hats, carried the farmers' cheeses, which typically weighed about 16 kg (35 lb), in barrows. Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual bargaining system called handjeklap in which buyers and sellers clap each other's hands and shout out prices. Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale. Modern Gouda had evolved by the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century.Cheesemaking traditionally was a woman's task in Dutch culture, with farmers' wives passing their cheesemaking skills on to their daughters. Most Dutch Gouda is now produced industrially. However, some 300 Dutch farmers still produce boerenkaas (\"farmer's cheese\"), which is a protected form of Gouda made in the traditional manner, using unpasteurised milk.\n\nProcess\nVarious sources suggest that the term Gouda refers more to a general style of cheesemaking rather than to a specific kind of cheese, pointing to its taste, which varies with age. Young (and factory-produced) Gouda has been described as having a flavour that is \"lightly fudgy with nuts, but very, very, very mild\", while the same source describes a more mature farmhouse Gouda as having a \"lovely fruity tang\" with a \"sweet finish\", that may take on \"an almost butterscotch flavour\" if aged over two years.After cultured milk is curdled, some of the whey is then drained and water is added. This is called \"washing the curd\", and creates a sweeter cheese, as the washing removes some of the lactose, resulting in a reduction of lactic acid produced. About 10% of the mixture is curds, which are pressed into circular  moulds for several hours. These moulds are the essential reason behind its traditional, characteristic shape. The cheese is then soaked in a brine solution, which gives the cheese and its rind a distinctive taste.The cheese is dried for a few days before being coated with a yellow wax or plastic-like coating to prevent it from drying out. It is then aged, during which process the cheese changes from semi-hard to hard. Dutch cheese makers generally use six gradations, or categories, to classify the cheese:\n\nYoung cheese (4 weeks)\nYoung matured\t(8\u201310 weeks)\nMatured (16\u201318 weeks)\nExtra matured\t(7\u20139 months)\nOld cheese (10\u201312 months)\nVery old cheese (12 months to 20 months)As it ages, it develops a caramel sweetness and has a slight crunchiness from cheese crystals, especially in older cheeses. In the Netherlands, cubes of Gouda are often eaten as a snack served with Dutch mustard. Older varieties are sometimes topped with sugar or apple butter. Cubes of Gouda are commonly served as a snack along with beer in traditional Dutch Brown Bars.\n\nSensory and chemical properties\nChemical properties\nIn most cases, the moisture content of Gouda cheese falls somewhere in the range of 40% to 50%. The amount of moisture that is present in Gouda cheese plays an important part in determining its texture. Cheeses that include higher moisture levels have a tendency to be softer and more creamy, whilst cheeses that have a lower moisture content have a tendency to be stiffer and may develop a crystalline structure as they age. Gouda cheese has a high moisture content.\nGouda cheese has a variable fat content, typically ranging from 20% to 40%. The fat content contributes to the cheese's texture, and allows for the transportation and release of flavour-enhancing chemicals, increasing the cheese's overall flavour profile. The fat level also affects the cheese's melting properties.Certain aroma-active chemicals that are found in Gouda cheese are responsible for the cheese's distinctive flavour character, which can be traced back to those components. Six components are believed to be distinctive of all Gouda cheeses:\n\nDiacetyl\n2-Methylbutanal\n3-Methylbutanal\nMethional\nEthyl butyrate\nAcetic acidCasein (the primary protein found in cows' milk) is the predominant type of protein found in gouda cheese, which contributes to the cheese's high protein content. During the manufacturing process, casein coagulates to create the curds, which contributes to the cheese's stiffness and overall structure.\n\nFlavour\nGouda cheese is recognised for its diverse flavour profile. Gouda cheese can exhibit a wide range of flavour qualities, from mild and creamy to harsh and acidic, depending on its age. The flavours develop as Gouda cheeses reach the medium stage of maturation, showing extra whey, sour aromatics, and a somewhat cooked or milky essence, increasing the cheese's complexity. Matured Gouda has a rich, caramel-like flavour, which is developed after prolonged ripening, along with brothy and malty or nutty undertones. Depending on how long the cheese has been aged, the finish can range from silky to sharp.\n\nAppearance and texture\nGouda cheese has a solid and springy texture. The cheese gets crystalline as it ages. Young Gouda cheese often has a smooth, creamy texture and a pale ivory to light yellow colour. The cheese's look changes into a richer golden hue as it becomes older, and its texture becomes more crumbly and firm. Small crystals within aged Gouda cheese may also be visible.\n\nNutritional value\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, some of the gouda cheese nutritional facts are listed below.\n\nProtection\nThe term \"Gouda\" is not restricted to cheese of Dutch origin. However, \"Boerenkaas\", \"Noord-Hollandse Gouda\", and \"Gouda Holland\" are protected geographical indications in the European Union. These cheeses can be made only in the Netherlands (although not only in the Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland, in which Gouda is situated) and can use milk produced only by Dutch cows.\n\nSee also\nList of cheeses\nList of Dutch cheeses\nList of smoked foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Media related to Gouda cheese at Wikimedia Commons\nA collection of old pictures and drawings of Gouda.

        "body": "Potato Corner is a global Philippine food franchise known for its flavored French fries. Potato Corner's first stall opened up in SM Megamall on October 16, 1992 in the Philippines under Cinco Corporation. As of 2022, Potato Corner is present in 19 countries globally which include the Philippines, Indonesia, the United States, Panama, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Kuwait, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates and China.\n\nInternational expansion\nPotato Corner was founded by Jose Magsaysay Jr., Ricky Montelibano, Danny Bermejo and George Wieneke in 1992. Montelibano is Magsaysay's brother-in-law and was the first to introduce flavored popcorn to the Philippines. Although he had been working for a local Wendy's for nine years, Magsaysay needed to support his family and came up with the idea of flavored fries, based on Montelibano's business. They had to borrow money to raise the starting financial capital of \u20b1150,000 (US$6,000). Magsaysay left his management job at Wendy's and the first Potato Corner, a cart in Mandaluyong, opened in October 1992. Within thirty days, all of them were able to pay back their loans.\nAfter their initial success, they began to consider expanding through franchises. Magsaysay knew only the basics of franchising from his job at Wendy's and at the time it was a novel idea in the Philippines. As such, their first franchisee agreements were largely informal and their first franchisee signed a document they copied from online. The group raised funds for their expansion and quickly became large in the local market.In 2006, Potato Corner opened its first international store in Indonesia. This was followed by Potato Corner's first entry in the United States in February 2010 and first store in the United States in 2012. In April 2017, Potato Corner opened its first Hong Kong franchise in Tsim Sha Tsui. As of 2022, Potato Corner is available in the Philippines, Indonesia, the United States, Panama, Australia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam, Kuwait, Malaysia, Canada, Myanmar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. In late 2022, the franchise expanded to the United Kingdom opening the first outlet in London. The franchise also expanded to New Zealand opening its first outlet in Auckland and in the United Arab Emirates opening their first outlet store in Ibn Battuta Mall.\n\nAwards and recognition\nPotato Corner garnered a number of accolades through the years. Potato Corner bagged the Best Franchisee of the Year for three consecutive years from PFA and DTI. Awarded by the same organizations, Potato Corner also received the Franchisee Excellence Hall of Fame Award in 2003 and the Global Filipino Franchise Award in 2017.\n\nMarketing and advertising\nMascot\nPotato Corner's official mascot, Spudster, was introduced by the brand in 2009, and can be seen in all of its stores and buckets. Spudster received a Master License for Los Angeles County in 2009.\n\nCriticisms and controversies\nIn August 2023, Potato Corner Philippines received criticism when a discriminatory job posting went viral on social media.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "body": "Funnel cake (Pennsylvania German: Drechderkuche) is a regional sweet food popular in North America, found mainly at carnivals and amusement parks. It is made by deep-frying batter.\n\nHistory\nThe concept of the funnel cake dates back to the early medieval Persian and Arab world as zalabiyeh, where similar yeast-risen dishes were first prepared, and later spread to Europe. Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants brought the yeast dish, known as drechderkuche, to America, and around 1879, they developed the baking powder version along with its new name, funnel cake.\n\nPreparation\nFunnel cakes are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil in a circular pattern and deep frying the overlapping mass until golden-brown. The batter is commonly poured through a funnel, creating its texture and giving it its name. When made at concession stands, a pitcher with an integral funnel spout is employed. Alton Brown recommends they be made with choux pastry, which expands from steam produced by its high water content.\nFunnel cakes are typically served plain with powdered sugar but can also be served with jam/jelly, cinnamon, chocolate, fresh fruit, or other toppings.\n\nCultural variations\nEurope\nIn south German cuisine, the equivalent is called Strauben or Strieble and is made and served similarly. In Finnish cuisine, the analogous tippaleip\u00e4 (literally droplet bread) is traditionally served at May Day (Vappu) celebrations, alongside sima. In Lithuania, it is called skruzd\u0117lynas, which literally translates to \"ant nest\". It is normally made in early spring to empty last year's honey stock and make more space for the new one, and it is also made at the first harvest of honey. The Armenian equivalent mrjnabujn (hy:\u0544\u0580\u057b\u0576\u0561\u0562\u0578\u0582\u0575\u0576 (\u057f\u0578\u0580\u0569)) also translates to \"ant nest\".\n\nAsia\nIn the Indian subcontinent, a similar dessert, with a crystallized sugary exterior coating, is called jalebi. In Iran, this is known as zulbia and is a popular dessert. These differ from funnel cake in using no baking powder, which results in a somewhat chewy texture.Kumukunsi is another similar native doughnut from the Maguindanao people in the Philippines. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. They have the taste and consistency of creamy pancakes.\n\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., funnel cakes were originally associated with Pennsylvania Dutch Country. It is one of the first North American fried foods, which is associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch, German immigrants who came to Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, it is a staple dish that can be found at amusement parks and fairs all over the country. The name \"funnel\" later came from the technique used to make the cakes, in which the pancake-like batter is poured into hot oil through a funnel.\n\nSee also\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of fried dough foods\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nPennsylvania Dutch cuisine\n\nReferences\nSources\n\"Calories in Funnel Cake and Nutrition Facts\".

The butter, sugar and bananas are cooked, and then alcohol is added and ignited. The bananas and sauce are then served over the ice cream. Popular toppings also include whipped cream and different types of nuts (pecans, walnuts, etc.).  The dish is often prepared tableside as a flamb\u00e9.\n\nHistory\nBananas Foster is an American dessert that originated in New Orleans made with cooked bananas served in a butter, brown sugar and rum sauce. The caramelized liquor-based sauce is often prepared via flamb\u00e9. This dessert can be served with vanilla ice cream or as a cr\u00eape filling, but it may also be eaten on its own. Cinnamon and nutmeg may be added as seasoning.Though many think the dish was created at the restaurant Brennan's in New Orleans, Louisiana, it actually got its start a few years earlier in Owen Brennan's Vieux Carr\u00e9 restaurant. In 1951, Ella Brennan and the restaurant's chef Paul Blang\u00e9 worked together to modify a dish made by Ella's mother in the Brennan family home. At this time, New Orleans was a major hub for the import of bananas from South America. It was named for Richard Foster, the chairman of the New Orleans Crime Commission and a friend of restaurant owner Owen Brennan.\n\nSee also\nCherries jubilee\nCuisine of New Orleans\nList of American desserts\nList of banana dishes\nLouisiana Creole cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Christmas pudding is sweet, dried-fruit pudding traditionally served as part of Christmas dinner in Britain and other countries to which the tradition has been exported. It has its origins in medieval England, with early recipes making use of dried fruit, suet, breadcrumbs, flour, eggs and spice, along with liquid such as milk or fortified wine. Later, recipes became more elaborate. In 1845, cookery writer Eliza Acton wrote the first recipe for a dish actually called \"Christmas pudding\".\nThe dish is sometimes known as plum pudding (though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving dried fruit). The word \"plum\" was used then for what has been called a \"raisin\" since the 18th century, and the pudding does not in fact contain plums in the modern sense of the word.\n\nBasics\nSome households have their own recipes for Christmas pudding, which may be handed down through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients \u2014 notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with suet. The pudding is very dark, almost black in appearance due to the dark sugars and black treacle in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, brandy and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark beers such as mild, stout or porter).\n\nPrior to the 19th century, the English Christmas pudding was boiled in a pudding cloth, and often represented as round. The Victorian era fashion involved putting the mixture into a basin and then steaming it, followed by unwrapping the pudding, placing it on a platter, and decorating the top with a sprig of holly.Initial cooking usually involves steaming for many hours. Most pre-twentieth century recipes assume that the pudding will then be served immediately, but in the second half of the twentieth century, it became more usual to reheat puddings on the day of serving, and recipes changed slightly to allow for maturing. To serve, the pudding is reheated by steaming once more, and may be dressed with warm brandy which is set alight. It can be eaten with hard sauce (usually brandy butter or rum butter), cream, lemon cream, ice cream, custard, or sweetened b\u00e9chamel, and is sometimes sprinkled with caster sugar.\n\nHistory\nLegends\nThere is a popular myth that plum pudding's association with Christmas goes back to a custom in medieval England that the \"pudding should be made on the 25th Sunday after Trinity, that it be prepared with 13 ingredients to represent Christ and the 12 apostles, and that every family member stir it in turn from east to west to honour the Magi and their journey in that direction\". However, recipes for plum puddings appear mainly, if not entirely, in the 17th century and later. One of the earliest plum pudding recipes is given by Mary Kettilby in her 1714 book A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery. There is a popular and wholly unsubstantiated myth that in 1714, George I of Great Britain (sometimes known as the Pudding King) requested that plum pudding be served as part of his royal feast in his first Christmas in England.\n\nAncestors\nChristmas pudding's possible ancestors include savoury puddings such as those in Harley MS 279, croustades, malaches whyte, creme boiled (a kind of stirred custard), and sippets. Various ingredients and methods of these older recipes appear in early plum puddings. An early example of a bag pudding (without fruit) is \"fraunche mele\" in the Liber Cure Cocorum Pudding \"had the great merit\" of not needing to be cooked in an oven, something \"most lower class households did not have\". Pudding predecessors often contained meat, as well as sweet ingredients, and prior to being steamed in a cloth the ingredients may have been stuffed into the gut or stomach of an animal, like haggis or sausages.As techniques for meat preserving improved in the 18th century, the savoury element of both the mince pie and the plum pottage diminished as the sweet content increased. People began adding dried fruit and sugar. The mince pie kept its name, though the pottage was increasingly referred to as plum pudding. As plum pudding, it became widespread as a feast dish, not necessarily associated with Christmas, and usually served with beef. It makes numerous appearances in 18th century satire as a symbol of Britishness, including the Gilray cartoon, The Plumb-pudding in danger.\n\nVictorian era\nIt was not until the 1830s that a boiled cake of flour, fruits, suet, sugar and spices, all topped with holly, made a definite appearance, becoming more and more associated with Christmas.  In her bestselling 1845 book Modern Cookery for Private Families, the East Sussex cook Eliza Acton was the first to refer to it as \"Christmas Pudding\".\n\nBritish Empire\nThe custom of eating Christmas pudding was carried to many parts of the world by British colonists. It is a common dish in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa. Throughout the colonial period, the pudding was a symbol of unity throughout the British Empire.In 1927, the Empire Marketing Board (EMB) wrote a letter to the Master of the Royal Household, requesting a copy of the recipe used to make the Christmas pudding for the royal family. The King and Queen granted Leo Amery, the head of the EMB, permission to use the recipe in a publication in the following November. The royal chef, Henry C\u00e9dard, provided it. In order to distribute the recipe, the EMB had to overcome two challenges: size and ingredients. First, the original recipe was measured to serve 40 people, including the entire royal family and their guests. The EMB was challenged to rework the recipe to serve only 8 people. Second, the ingredients used to make the pudding had to be changed to reflect the ideals of the Empire. The origins of each ingredient were carefully manipulated to represent some of the Empire's many colonies. Brandy from Cyprus and nutmeg from the West Indies, which had been inadvertently forgotten in previous recipes, made special appearances. However, there were a number of colonies that produced the same foodstuffs. The final recipe included Australian currants, South African stoned raisins, Canadian apples, Jamaican rum and English Beer, among other ingredients all sourced from somewhere in the Empire. After finalising the ingredients, the royal recipe was sent out to national newspapers and to popular women's magazines. Copies were also printed and handed out to the public for free. The recipe was a phenomenal success, as thousands of requests for the recipe flooded the EMB office.In 1931, an annual Christmas market for the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 and 25 November. A 10-ton Christmas pudding, the largest ever created up until that time, was featured. The recipe became known as the \"Prince of Wales' Empire Christmas Pudding\". The Times newspaper noted \"The Lord Mayor of London has promised to give the pudding its first 'stir'. He will be followed by the High Commissioners of the Dominions, and afterwards the general public will have the chance of stirring it\". The Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) was then a patron of the PDSA charity. It was then divided up into 11,208 smaller puddings, which were distributed amongst the poor throughout the country. Manchester and Salford, for example, received 512 each.\n\nUnited States\nIn America, the tradition of the Christmas pudding had already arrived in pre-independence days. A book entitled The Williamsburg Art of Cookery by Helen Bullock was published in the U.S. as early as 1742. Among the ingredients she includes a pound of each of a variety of dried fruits and sugar, plus half a pound each of candied peel (citron, orange and lemon). She also adds one pint of brandy and 12 eggs. \nJane Cunningham Croly published a 19th-century recipe for plum pudding contributed to Jennie June's American Cookery Book by the American poet sisters Alice Cary and Phoebe Cary. It was made as bread pudding, by soaking stale bread in milk then adding suet, candied citron, nutmeg, eggs, raisins and brandy. It was a moulded dessert, cooked in boiling water for several hours, and served with a sweet wine sauce.\n\nWishing and other traditions\nIt was in the late Victorian era that 'Stir up Sunday' (the fifth Sunday before Christmas) began to be associated with the making of Christmas pudding. The collect this Sunday in the Church of England's Book of Common Prayer begins with the words \"Stir up, we beseech thee, O Lord, the wills of thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruit of good works...\". This led to the custom of preparing Christmas puddings on that day which became known as Stir-up Sunday, associated with the stirring of the Christmas pudding.Initially probably a schoolchild joke, latterly the day became known as \"Stir-up Sunday\". By the 1920s, the custom was established that everyone in the household, or at least every child (and sometimes the servants), gave the mixture a stir and made a wish while doing so.It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them. The usual choice was a silver threepence or a sixpence. The coin was believed to bring wealth in the coming year, and came from an earlier tradition of putting tokens in a cake, which had died out by the twentieth century (see Twelfth Cake).\nOther tokens are also known to have been included, such as a tiny wishbone (to bring good luck), a silver thimble (for thrift) or an anchor (to symbolise safe harbour).Once turned out of its basin, decorated with holly, doused in brandy (or occasionally rum), and flamed (or \"fired\"), the pudding is traditionally brought to the table ceremoniously, and greeted with a round of applause. In 1843, Charles Dickens describes the scene in A Christmas Carol:\n\nMrs Cratchit left the room alone \u2013 too nervous to bear witnesses \u2013 to take the pudding up and bring it in... Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper which smells like a washing-day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that. That was the pudding. In half a minute Mrs Cratchit entered \u2013 flushed, but smiling proudly \u2013 with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quarter of ignited brandy, and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Spruce Eats: Traditional Christmas Pudding Recipe",

        "body": "In Greek cuisine, saganaki (Greek \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9) is any one of a variety of dishes prepared in a small frying pan,  the best-known being an appetizer of fried cheese. It is commonly flamb\u00e9ed in North America.\n\nEtymology\nThe dishes are named for the frying pan in which they are prepared, called a \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 : sagan\u00e1ki, which is a diminutive of \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9 : sag\u00e1ni, a frying pan with two handles, which comes from the Turkish word sahan 'copper dish', itself borrowed from Arabic \u0635\u062d\u0646 (\u1e63a\u1e25n).\n\nDescription\nThe cheese used in saganaki is usually graviera, kefalograviera, halloumi, kasseri, kefalotyri, or sheep's milk feta cheese. Regional variations include the use of formaela cheese in Arachova, halloumi in Cyprus, and vlahotiri in Metsovo. The cheese is melted in a small frying pan until it is bubbling and generally served with lemon juice and pepper. It is eaten with bread.Other dishes cooked in a saganaki pan include shrimp saganaki (Greek: \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, gar\u00eddes sagan\u00e1ki), and mussels saganaki (Greek: \u03bc\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9, m\u00fddia sagan\u00e1ki), which are typically feta-based and include a spicy tomato sauce.\n\nNorth American serving style\nIn many Greek restaurants in the United States and Canada, after the saganaki cheese is fried, it is flamb\u00e9ed at table (often with a shout of \"opa!\"), after which the flames usually are extinguished with a squeeze of lemon juice. This is called \"flaming saganaki\" and apparently originated in 1968 at the Parthenon restaurant in Chicago's Greektown, based on the suggestion of a customer.\n\nSee also\nLeip\u00e4juusto\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nList of Greek dishes\nSaganaki cheese\nSma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "The backdraft is a cocktail that is noted for its elaborate preparation and potency. Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact.\nThe procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink.\n\nClassical backdraft preparation\nA classic backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter.  The mixture is set alight, and after a few seconds, extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand, although often a coaster or saucer is used instead.  Once the flame is out, a straw is inserted, keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors.\nBoth the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw.\nDrambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite, if not impossible, so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151.\n\nAlternate \"shooter\" backdraft preparation\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\nA saucer is placed on a counter or table.\nA shot glass is placed in the center of the saucer, filled with Sambuca\nA pint glass is filled with 1\u20132 shots of Cointreau. Swirl this in the glass to coat the sides\nThe Cointreau is lit and allowed to burn until the sides of the glass become warm to the touch\nThe lit Cointreau is poured into the shot glass, igniting the Sambuca\nCinnamon (or black pepper in the case of a pepperdraft) is sprinkled into the flaming alcohol from about 1/3 of a meter (1 foot) above the shot glass.  The finely powdered spice will ignite in the flame. Important: All the while the pint glass must be kept upside down above the flames to catch the alcohol vapor coming off the burning liquids.\nWhen approximately 3-6 good shakes of cinnamon have been dispensed, the pint glass is lowered over the flaming liquid. Note:  the liquid on the outside of the inverted pint glass will still burn and needs to be gently blown out. The upside down pint glass is smaller than the coffee cup saucer, and will thus seal to the saucer extinguishing the flames inside\nAs the alcohol cools inside the pint glass it will try to suck the alcohol on the outside back into the upside down pint glass. This backdraft effect is the origin of the drink's name.\nThe pint glass is removed and 2\u20133 ice cubes are placed into it.  The opening of the pint glass is immediately sealed with the palm of the bartender's hand.\nThe pint glass is shaken: this has the effect of cooling the alcohol vapors and causing them to condense on the ice cubes, the walls of the glass and the air inside the glass.\nPreparation is now complete.  The drinker first downs the shot or drinks it through a straw.  Then the straw is slipped through the bartender's fingers into the pint glass, whereby the drinker \"drinks\" the condensed alcohol - actually mainly inhaling the alcohol vapors inside the glass.  Finally, the drinker uses the straw to suck up the spirits which have collected in the saucer.  The combination of ingested and inhaled alcohol makes this drink extremely potent.  The ice cubes (and the layer of condensed alcohol on them) may be eaten if desired.\n\nBackdraft physics\nWhen a gas is heated, its volume increases. It will displace cooler gases as it expands. If this is done in a partially enclosed space, and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas, when the heat is taken away, the gases cool and as they do, the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease. Therefore, most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense. As the gas cools, it decreases in volume, and the pressure drops. Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer, the dense, cold air is replaced with less dense, warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it. As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted, the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out, removing the heat source. The alcohol-laden warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference. The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside (as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect) as it begins to equalise the pressure difference. Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass, sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass. At some point an equilibrium will occur, where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside, and this will hold the liquid inside the glass. Sometimes, when a good seal is made, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted, the saucer will remain stuck to its underside.\nWhen the pint glass is removed, ice is immediately added, thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour, creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails. By covering the glass with the hand, this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation, usually through a straw.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBackdraft video from Youtube",

        "body": "Feuerzangenbowle () is a traditional German alcoholic drink for which a rum-soaked sugarloaf is set on fire and drips into mulled wine. It is often part of a Christmas or New Year's Eve tradition. The name translates literally as fire-tongs punch, \"Bowle\" meaning \"punch\" being borrowed from English.\nThe popularity of the drink was boosted in Germany by the 1944 comedy film Die Feuerzangenbowle. It is a traditional drink of some German fraternities, who also call it Krambambuli, as the red color is reminiscent of a cherry liqueur of that name which was manufactured by the distillery Der Lachs zu Danzig (in Gda\u0144sk).\n\nProcedure\nFeuerzangenbowle is prepared in a bowl, similar to a fondue set, which usually is suspended over a small burner (Rechaud). The bowl is filled with heated dry red wine spiced with cinnamon sticks, cloves, star anise and orange peel, similar to mulled wine. The Feuerzange was originally a pair of tongs, but nowadays it is common for a purpose-designed metal grate mounted on top of the bowl to hold the Zuckerhut (sugarloaf), a 250-gram (9 oz) lump of sugar. The sugar is soaked with rum and set alight, melting and caramelizing. The rum should have at least 54% alcohol by volume (ABV), such as the high-ABV Austrian rum Stroh 80, and be at room temperature in order to burn properly. More rum is poured with a ladle until all the sugar has melted and mixed with the wine. The resulting punch is served in mugs while the burner keeps the bowl warm. For some the ceremony is more important than the drink itself, celebrating the gathering of friends and conveying a notion of Gem\u00fctlichkeit.\n\nSee also\nFlaming drink\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Feuerzangenbowle at Wikimedia Commons\n Feuerzangenbowle at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject",

Due to the sour plums used in its production, suanmeitang is slightly salty in addition to being sweet and rather sour.\nSuanmeitang is commercially available in China and other parts of the world with Chinese communities. It is often drunk chilled during the summertime, as relief from the heat, and is one of the most common summer drinks in China. In addition to being widely considered an effective drink for cooling off in the heat, it is also popularly believed to have minor health benefits, such as improving digestion and possibly inhibiting the buildup of lactic acid in the body.\n\nHistory\nSuanmeitang has existed in some form for over 1,000 years, at least since the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 CE); there are also reports of a variation called \"white suanmeitang\" (\u767d\u9178\u6885\u6c64) during the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368 CE). The recipe used today is thought to have been developed at the request of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty during the early 18th century, at which time it was first common in the imperial courts, and was later popularized among common folk when a Hebei citizen created and produced the Xinyuanzhai (\u4fe1\u8fdc\u658b) brand. By the 1980s, companies had begun to use industrial methods and technology to mass-produce suanmeitang.\n\nIngredients and production\nSuanmeitang is made by first soaking sour plums in water, then adding haw, liquorice root, and sweet osmanthus and boiling them together. Rose blossoms may also be added. After the mixture is boiled, rock sugar is added to the residue, it is boiled again, and after the beverage has cooled off it is chilled.\n\nSee also\nUmeshu \u2013 Japanese liqueur\nMaesil-ju \u2013 Korean plum wine\nPrune juice\nList of plum dishes\nList of smoked foods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Flaming volcano is a large tropical group cocktail typically made with rum, brandy, pineapple juice, orange juice, and orgeat syrup. Many variations exist, and the cocktail in the 21st century is more about the presentation than an adherence to a set list of ingredients.  It is usually a multi-user drink, served to a group in a special vessel known as a volcano bowl, which is a decorative ceramic bowl (typically of about 32 US fluid ounces (950 ml) capacity) designed with a rising central hub feature resembling a volcanic cone.  The cone includes a \"crater\" reservoir which can be partially filled with rum or another flammable liquor. The crater liquor is carefully ignited when serving, creating a mild volcanic ambiance with its central blue flame.A flaming volcano is usually served to a group of two or more people with a set of very long straws to facilitate convenient group sipping from a comfortable distance and for safety. It is sometimes called a scorpion bowl.\n\nHistory\nThe communal flaming volcano drink is said to have been started in Hawaii in the 1950s or 1960s as a cross between flammable one person ice formed \"volcano cockails\" and larger communal bowl cocktails. Jeff Berry in Beachbum Berry Remixed has Don the Beachcomber as an early example of serving the larger flaming bowl at his location in St. Paul, Minnesota. He also lists a Lei Lani Volcano variation from the Polyneisan Village Resort (Walt Disney World) from the 1970s. It is typically served only at tiki bars. It also has strong roots in its precursor, the scorpion bowl.\nSome claim that it originated from or was popular in Chile during the times of Augusto Pinochet., but credible sources, especially as to the drink's original Chilean origin, are non-existent.\n\nPreparation and variations\nOne version of flaming volcano is prepared by blending the ingredients with ice. It is sometimes served with dry ice to provide for a fog effect. The base liquor is usually some form of rum, with brandy commonly added, but vodka and even gin appear in some recipes. Other versions might use lime juice, grapefruit juice, maple syrup, guava nectar, or coconut rum.The cocktail was also rebranded as \"the mystery drink\" at tiki Bars such as the Kahiki and the Mai Kai.Early versions of the ceramic bowl were made by Orchids of Hawaii and Bamboo of China.  Newer versions have been designed by artists such as Shag (pictured) and others.\n\nIn popular culture\nAs noted in the book The B-52's Universe by Mats Sexton, the band The B-52's formed after its members shared a flaming volcano at a Chinese Restaurant in Athens, Georgia in November 1976. Due to a lack of funds, the band had decided to share a cocktail rather than order any food.\n\nSee also\nList of cocktails\nTiki mugs\nTiki culture\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "The Apfelk\u00fcchle is a traditional German pastry, consisting of sliced apples dipped in batter and fried to a golden-brown color. It is popular in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a federal state in southern Germany. The Apfelk\u00fcchle has spread throughout Europe and the US. It is similar to an apple fritter but is made more like a pancake, and can be prepared in several ways. While it is traditionally eaten as a complete meal, because of its sweet taste, Apfelk\u00fcchle has also become popular as a dessert.\n\nEtymology\nThe word Apfelk\u00fcchle consists of two words: Apfel, meaning apple, and K\u00fcchle, a diminutive in Swabian German of Kuchen, meaning cake. A possible translation is little apple pie.\n\nHistory\nIt is not completely certain when Apfelk\u00fcchle were first made, however it is known that the pastry was created in south-west Germany in the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where it has been a long-standing traditional meal. Recently, Apfelk\u00fcchle has spread beyond Germany's borders and has become very popular.\n\nSeason\nApples do not tend to tolerate long storage through the colder seasons. Making Apfelk\u00fcchle is a way to use the spare apples picked in the summer and early autumn. A large number of apples that would otherwise be wasted or were slightly damaged before they could be eaten (either en route to the vendor or damaged during harvest), can be used to make Apfelk\u00fcchle.\n\nFat Thursday\nApfelk\u00fcchle is traditionally eaten in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg on Fat Thursday, the Thursday prior to Rose Monday (Carnival Monday), similar to eating paczki on Fat Tuesday. Apfelk\u00fcchle is traditionally eaten as a main course, however in recent years it has often been served as a dessert. During Carnival, the Apfelk\u00fcchle is a must. It is also part of every religious holiday in southern Germany.\n\nPreparation\nMain ingredients\nThere are a few different ways to make Apfelk\u00fcchle. Most recipes differ mainly in minor ingredients, which are swapped out based on personal taste. Apfelk\u00fcchle all have a main ingredient of apples and dough (made from eggs, flour, sugar, salt, and milk). Different variations of dough can be made by adding extras such as beer, fruit brandy, and cinnamon.\n\nConsumption\nSince the end of the 18th century, it has become common to use a variety of sauces to refine dishes in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. As a popular dish in that area, Apfelk\u00fcchle is often served with its own variety of sauces and sides. The most common way to eat Apfelk\u00fcchle is warm with cinnamon and sugar, or dusted with powdered sugar. One of the most popular refinements is to serve it cold with a vanilla sauce. It is also popular, especially among children, to serve Apfelk\u00fcchle with vanilla ice cream. Cooks in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg also like to flamb\u00e9 it with Grand Marnier or rum and serve it with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Another sauce used to dress Apfelk\u00fcchle is Chaudeausauce, a French term for hot water, which is composed mainly of wine, vinegar, lemon juice, egg yolks and sugar. It is traditionally made with white wine; usually champagne, and occasionally with a shot of cognac or sherry. It can be enjoyed both hot and cold.\n\nSee also\nList of pastries\nApple dumplings\nGerman baked apples\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRecipe for Apfelk\u00fcchle with vanilla sauce",

It is served at restaurants and food trucks throughout Arkansas. The dish is also served in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. They are considered to be a delicacy of southern cuisine. Buffalo fish are sometimes looked down upon because of their boniness and their reputation as bottom feeders. They have historically been more widely eaten by minority groups such as African-Americans, and are considered soul food. Southern Living included Lassis' buffalo ribs on its list of \"The South's Best Soul Food\". In the 21st century, the popularity of buffalo ribs has declined to modernizing diet patterns.\n\nDescription\nBigmouth buffalo fish have gamey white meat with a flaky texture that is streaked with fat. With the exception of the meat around its ribs near the head, the fish's flesh contains small, free-floating bones. The ribs, along with the boneless meat surrounding them, are typically removed as fillets or \"slabs\". The ribs are prepared by breading them in an egg and cornmeal mixture, before deep-frying them in a manner similar to catfish. They are traditionally served with a side of french fries or hushpuppies.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFISH RIBS IN LITTLE ROCK (video)",

Onions and various spices are added, and the mixture is then fried until it obtains a crispy brown surface.Because sandworms can only be found in autumn, the dish is not available year-round and is considered a specialty during the autumn. Some vendors use frozen sandworms to be able to serve the dish year-round, but the taste of the fresh sandworms is considered superior.

    "Category:Tomatoes": {
        "body": "Fried green tomatoes are a culinary dish usually found in the United States, made from unripe (green) tomatoes coated with cornmeal and fried.Recipes in the early 20th century were mainly published in the Northeastern United States and Midwestern United States. They became known as a food of the Southern United States after they were featured in the film Fried Green Tomatoes.\n\nTraditional preparation\nTraditional preparation of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices.  They are then seasoned with salt and pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat for a few minutes each side, or until golden brown.  Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato.\nAlternatives include using breadcrumbs or flour instead of cornmeal and frying in vegetable oil or other fat.\nThe sliced tomatoes may be dipped in a liquid before the cornmeal is added.  This liquid is usually buttermilk or beaten egg; egg results in a slightly firmer texture than buttermilk.  Liquids are used because cornmeal does not readily stick to tomato slices. Adding the liquid helps the cornmeal stay in place during the cooking process.  It also results in the coating on the tomato becoming thicker and less crunchy when compared to tomatoes cooked without a liquid wash.\n\nDistribution of the dish and popularity from the film\nHistorian Robert F. Moss found that from 1900-1911, there were 11 recipes for the dish published in U.S. newspapers. The articles were from the Northeastern United States and Midwestern United States. Moss believes that the dish originated from those areas, \"perhaps with a link to Jewish immigrants\".According to Moss, instructors in cooking in home economics courses adopted the dish. The sole instance of the recipe in the 1920s in the southern United States' newspapers came from an article that was in syndication across the United States, instead of being specifically from the South. From the 1930s to the 1960s, there was one instance of the recipe in Southern American newspapers. After the film Fried Green Tomatoes was released, Americans associated the dish with the South despite the lack of evidence that the dish was previously widely prepared in the U.S. South.As of 2017, within West Virginia, the dish is more often found in the southern portion of the state.\n\nPennsylvania Dutch version\nWhile fried green tomatoes are usually considered a southern dish they can be found in northern Pennsylvania Dutch homes as well. The northern version is more likely to be made with white flour rather than corn meal. Also, green tomatoes tend to be prepared at the end of the season in the north when the remaining fruit is harvested before the first frosts, whereas green tomatoes are picked throughout the season in the south.\n\nOther preparations\nFried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade is a southern and Creole combination served at many restaurants in New Orleans, Louisiana.While fried green tomatoes have traditionally been a side dish, they are sometimes used in main dishes:\n\nFried Green Tomato Po'Boy\nFried Green Tomato Parmesan\nFried Green Tomato Benedict\n\nSee also\nCuisine of the Southern United States\nList of tomato dishes\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

In ancient times, boating was a big industry and many people made a living by towing boats. Working under the damp and foggy weather made boat trackers feel very sick. And when they were hungry, they cooked herbs in a pot and put Sichuan pepper and ginger into the soup to eliminate dampness. Malatang was created, then vendors discovered the business opportunity, and spread it throughout China.Unlike hot pot, which is made to order and shared only by diners at a table, malatang originates from street food cooked in a communal pot. Diners can quickly choose what they wish to eat, and either eat on the spot or take away.\n\nPreparation\nSkewers\nTypically a table with a big and flat saucepan is set up on the street, with a large number of ingredients in skewers being cooked in a mildly spicy broth. Customers sit around the table and pick up whatever they want to eat. Given the large number of ingredients available, normally not all ingredients are in the saucepan at the same time, and customers may suggest what is missing and should be added.Customers keep the used wooden sticks by their plates, and when a customer finishes eating, the price to pay is determined by counting the number of empty sticks.\n\nBy weight\nIn the mid-2010s, malatang shops became popular in North China, especially Beijing. In these shops, the ingredients are usually displayed on shelves, and customers pick their desired ingredients into a bowl. Behind the counter, the selected ingredients are cooked in a spicy broth, usually at very high temperature for 3\u20134 minutes. Before serving, malatang is typically further seasoned with much garlic, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, chili pepper, sesame paste, and crushed peanuts. The price is calculated based on the weight of the self-picked ingredients.\n\nCommon ingredients\nSome of the common ingredients include:\n\nBenefits of malatang\nSupplementary nutrition\nA variety of vegetables and meat are often added to malatang, which has a rich variety of ingredients, and can absorb a variety of nutrients during eating, playing a role in balancing nutrition.\n\nHazards of malatang\nAt present, many businesses benefit from the trend of adding food additives and poppies that are banned by some countries during the cooking of malatang.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n The dictionary definition of malatang at Wiktionary",

        "body": "Tteokbokki (Korean: \ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), or simmered rice cake, is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok (long, white, cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon (\ub5a1\uba74; \"rice cake noodles\") or commonly tteokbokki-tteok (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774 \ub5a1; \"tteokbokki rice cakes\"). Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based sauce; the former is the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki).\nToday, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream sauce-tteokbokki, jajang-tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, rose-tteokbokki, galbi-tteokbokki and so on. Tteokbokki is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha (street stalls). There are also dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki (impromptu tteokbokki). It is also a popular home dish, as the rice cakes (garae-tteok) can be purchased in pre-packaged, semi-dehydrated form.\n\nHistory\nThe first record on tteok-bokki appears in Siuijeonseo, a 19th-century cookbook, where the dish was listed using the archaic spelling steokbokgi (\u112f\u1165\u11a8\ubcf5\uae30). According to the book, tteok-bokki was known by various names including tteokjjim (steamed rice cakes), tteok-japchae (stir-fried rice cakes), and tteok-jeongol (rice cakes hot pot). The royal court version was made from white tteok (rice cakes), sirloin, sesame oil, soy sauce, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds, while the savory, soy sauce-based tteok-bokki was made in the head house of the Papyeong Yun clan, where high-quality soy sauce was brewed. In this version, ingredients such as short ribs were common. The name tteok-bokki also appears in the revised and enlarged edition of Joseon Yori Jebeop, where it is described as a soy sauce-based savory dish.It is believed that the spicy variant of tteok-bokki made with gochujang-based sauce first appeared in 1953. When Ma Bok-Lim participated in the opening of a Korean-Chinese restaurant, she accidentally dropped tteok, or rice cake, that was handed during the opening into jajangmyeon. Realizing that it tasted good, she developed the idea of seasoning tteok in the Korean chili sauce, gochujang. After that, she began selling it in Sindang, which now has since become the most common variant of tteok-bokki. Consequently, the district of Sindang is now famously known for tteok-boki.\nToday, the typical tteok-bokki purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) and pojangmacha (street stalls) are red and spicy, while the soy sauce-based, non-spicy version is referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (\uad81\uc911\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"royal court tteok-bokki\"). Rice tteok rose in popularity as the South Korean economy developed, and various versions of the dish have proliferated since.  As it was once a working-class dish, wheat tteok was often substituted for rice tteok.It is well known as Korea's representative street food, but these days, in the process of globalizing Korean food, luxury and diversification are taking place, and branding based on know-how in cooking is also taking place. More and more stores around the world are selling tteokbokki directly, such as selling Korean red pepper paste tteokbokki for the first time in an American football stadium at the home of the NFL's Houston Texans.\n\nCalories\nThe basic tteokbokki is about 260 kcal per serving. Bizarre tteokbokki is about 1500 kcal per serving, and Yeopddeok Roje tteokbokki is about 2,600 kcal per serving. In addition, Shinjeon tteokbokki is about 490 kcal per serving, and emergency room tteokbokki is about 2,600 kcal per serving. Baetteok-roje tteokbokki is about 2500 kcal per serving.\n\nVarieties\nLike other popular Korean dishes, tteok-bokki has seen numerous variations and fusions. Boiled eggs and pan-fried mandu (dumplings) were traditionally added to tteok-bokki. Ingredients such as seafood, short ribs, instant noodles, chewy noodles are also common additions to the dish.\n\nVariations based on added ingredients\nHaemul-tteok-bokki, (\ud574\ubb3c\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"seafood tteok-bokki\") features seafood as its secondary ingredient.\nGalbi-tteok-bokki (\uac08\ube44\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"short rib tteok-bokki\") features short ribs as its secondary ingredient.\nRa-bokki (\ub77c\ubcf6\uc774; \"instant noodle tteok-bokki\") and jol-bokki (\ucac4\ubcf6\uc774; \"chewy noodle tteok-bokki\") are similar variants which add noodles to tteok-bokki. Ra-bokki adds ramyeon (ramen) noodles, and jjol-bokki adds chewy jjolmyeon wheat noodles.\n\nJeukseok-tteok-bokki\nJeongol (hot pot)-type tteok-bokki is called jeukseok-tteok-bokki (\uc989\uc11d\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"on-the-spot tteok-bokki\"), and is boiled on a table-top stove during the meal. A variety of additions, such as vegetables, mandu (dumplings), and ramyeon or udong noodles are available at jeukseok-tteok-bokki restaurants. As jeukseok-tteok-bokki is usually a meal rather than a snack, it is often paired with bokkeum-bap (fried rice).\n\nVariation based on sauce\nGochujang tteokbokki\nPiquant, red gochujang-based tteok-bokki is one of Korea's most popular snacks. While both soup-style gungmul-tteok-bokki (\uad6d\ubb3c\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"soup tteok-bokki\") and dry gireum-tteok-bokki (\uae30\ub984\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"oil tteok-bokki\") are commonly enjoyed, the former is considered the de facto standard style. In gungmul-tteok-bokki, kelp-anchovy stock is often used to bring out the savory flavor. Gochugaru (chili powder) is often added for additional heat and color, while mullyeot (rice syrup) helps with sweetness and consistency. Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and diagonally sliced scallions are common additions to the dish. In gireum-tteok-bokki, the mixture of gochugaru (\uace0\ucda7\uac00\ub8e8; \"Korean chili powder\"), soy sauce, sugar or syrup, and sesame oil often replaces gochujang (chili paste). Soft tteok sticks are seasoned with the sauce mixture, then stir-fried in cooking oil with a handful of chopped scallions and served. Tongin Market in Jongno, Seoul is famous for its gireum-tteok-bokki.\nThere are also many variations in gochujang tteok-bokki, such as a version that is seasoned with perilla leaf.\n\nGunjung tteokbokki\nSweet and savory, brown soy sauce-based tteok-bokki is often referred to as gungjung-tteok-bokki (\uad81\uc911\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"royal court tteok-bokki\"). Its history dates back to a royal court dish before the introduction of chili pepper to the Korean peninsula in the mid-Joseon era (17th & 18th centuries). The earliest record of gungjung tteok-bokki is found in an 1800s cookbook called Siuijeonseo. Having a taste similar to japchae (stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables), it was enjoyed by the royals as a banchan and as a snack. Although traditional tteok-bokki was made with soup soy sauce, which is the traditional (and at the time, the only) type of soy sauce in pre-modern Korea, sweeter regular soy sauce has taken its place in modern times. Other traditional ingredients such as sirloin or short ribs, sesame oil, scallions, rock tripe, pine nuts, and toasted and ground sesame seeds are still commonly used in modern gungjung-tteok-bokki. Other ingredients such as mung bean sprouts, carrots, onions, dried Korean zucchini, garlic, and shiitake mushrooms are also common. The dish is typically served with egg garnish.\n\nOther variations\nGungmul (soup) tteok-bokki that are not based on either soy sauce or gochujang have also gained in popularity. There are some well-known variations.\nCurry tteok-bokki uses a yellow Korean-style curry base.\nCream sauce tteok-bokki uses a base inspired by carbonara. Cream sauce and bacon are used instead of gochujang and fish cakes.Rose tteok-bokki  named after rose pasta, as a variation. For this tteok-bokki, cream sauce is added to the basic tteok-bokki.\nMala tteok-bokki is a fusion tteok-bokki dish that uses a base inspired by Chinese malatang. This variation may include mala sauce, wide glass noodles, and bok choy in addition to traditional tteok-bokki ingredients.\nJajang-tteok-bokki features a sauce based on jajang (sweet bean paste).\nCheese tteok-bokki is a variant in which the tteok-bokki is either topped or stuffed with cheese. It is sold in snack bars and can also easily be made at home. Depending on personal preference, it can be eaten with seasonings such as green tea powder, herb powder, sesame, or parsley.\nOutside of Korea, Shanghainese ch\u01ceo ni\u00e1ng\u0101o (\u7092\u5e74\u7cd5) is a stir-fried dish made with tteok-like rice cakes sliced into flat oval shapes, scallions, beef, pork and cabbage.\n\nGireum and gyeran tteok-bokki\nGireum tteok-bokki (\uae30\ub984\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"oil tteok-bokki\") is a variety of tteok-bokki that is stir-fried in oil and served with little or no sauce.\nGyeran tteok-bokki (\uacc4\ub780\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774; \"egg tteok-bokki\") is another variation that features no sauce. Only tteok (rice cakes), eggs, vegetables, and seasonings (primarily salt) are used. It differs from gireum tteok-bokki in that it is not spicy.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nBunsik\nGimbap\nKorean cuisine\nKorean royal court cuisine\nRice cake\nSundae\nDeep frying\nNian gao\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website of Dongdaemoon Yeopgi Tteokbokki\nOfficial website of Sinjeon Tteokbokki\nOfficial website of BaeDDuck",

        "body": "Chick-fil-A, Inc. ( CHIK-fil-AY, a play on the American English pronunciation of \"filet\") is an American fast food restaurant chain and the largest chain specializing in chicken sandwiches. Headquartered in College Park, Georgia, Chick-fil-A operates 3,059 restaurants across 48 states, as well as in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The company also has operations in Canada, and previously had restaurants in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The restaurant has a breakfast menu, as well as a lunch and dinner menu. The chain also provides catering services.Chick-fil-A calls its specialty the \"original chicken sandwich\". It is a piece of deep-fried breaded boneless chicken breast served on a toasted bun with two slices of dill pickle, or with lettuce, tomato, and cheese.Many of the company's values are influenced by the Christian religious beliefs of its late founder, S. Truett Cathy (1921\u20132014), a devout Southern Baptist. Reflecting a commitment to Sunday Sabbatarianism, all Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed for business on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. During the Western Christian liturgical season of Lent, Chick-fil-A promotes fish sandwiches, following the Christian tradition of abstinence from meat during Lent. The company's conservative opposition to same-sex marriage has caused controversy, though the company began to loosen its stance on this issue from 2019. Despite numerous controversies and boycott attempts, the 2022 American Customer Satisfaction Index found that Chick-fil-A remained the country's favorite fast food chain for the eighth consecutive year, and has the highest per store sales of any fast food chain in the nation.\n\nHistory\nThe chain's origin can be traced to the Dwarf Grill (now the Dwarf House), a restaurant opened by S. Truett Cathy, the chain's former chairman and CEO, in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, in 1946, which is near the location of the  Ford Motor Company Atlanta Assembly Plant, for many years a source of many of the restaurant's patrons but later demolished.In 1961, after 15 years in the fast-food business, Cathy found a pressure-fryer that could cook the chicken sandwich in the same time it took to cook a hamburger. Following this discovery, he registered the name Chick-fil-A, Inc. The company's trademarked slogan, \"We Didn't Invent the Chicken, Just the Chicken Sandwich,\" refers to their flagship menu item, the Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Though Chick-Fil-A was the first national chain to make a fast, fried chicken sandwich its flagship item, it has been shown that Cathy's claim to have \"invented the chicken sandwich\" is false.From 1964 to 1967, the sandwich was licensed to over fifty eateries, including Waffle House and the concession stands of the new Houston Astrodome. The Chick-Fil-A sandwich was withdrawn from sale at other restaurants when the first dedicated location opened in 1967, in the food court of the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta.During the 1970s and early 1980s, the chain expanded by opening new locations in suburban malls' food courts. The first freestanding location was opened April 16, 1986, on North Druid Hills Road in Atlanta, Georgia, and the company began to focus more on stand-alone units rather than food courts. Although it has expanded outward from its original geographic base, most new restaurants are located in Southern US suburban areas.Since 1997, the Atlanta-based company has  sponsored the Peach Bowl, an annual college football bowl game played in Atlanta on New Year's Eve. Chick-fil-A also sponsors the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference of college athletics.In 2008, Chick-fil-A was among the first fast-food restaurants to become completely free of trans fats.In October 2015, the company opened its largest restaurant, a three-story 5,000 square feet (460 m2) restaurant in Manhattan.\nOn December 17, 2017, Chick-fil-A broke their tradition and opened on a Sunday to prepare meals for passengers left stranded during a power outage at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, and on January 13, 2019, a Chick-fil-A franchise in Mobile, Alabama, opened on Sunday to honor a birthday wish of a 14-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and autism.On February 13, 2023, they began offering their first non-meat sandwich, a breaded cauliflower sandwich.In May 2023, Chick-fil-A closed its first stand-alone restaurant, in Greenbriar Mall, Atlanta, without stating a reason.In March 2024, Chick-fil-A announced it would depart from the company's previous commitment of using only \"antibiotic-free\" chicken.\n\nBusiness model\nChick-fil-A's business strategy involves a focus on a small menu and on customer service.  While many fast food chains offer many dishes, Chick-fil-A's  is focused on selling chicken sandwiches. The name's capital A is intended to indicate that their chicken is \"grade A top quality\". The company's emphasis on customer service is reported to have contributed to its success and growth in the United States.Chick-fil-A builds and owns its  restaurants. Chick-fil-A franchisees need a US$10,000 initial investment. Franchisees are selected and trained, a process that can take months.\nChick-fil-A grossed an average of $6.71 million per restaurant in 2022, despite opening only 6 days a week, the highest sales of all fast-food restaurants in the United States. (Raising Cane's was second with $5.44 million per restaurant average).In 2019, Chick-fil-A reported $11.3 billion in sales in the United States, behind only McDonald's with $40.4 billion in sales that year.To compete with Chick-fil-A, fried chicken chain Popeyes, followed by others, introduced a fried chicken sandwich in 2019, starting the Chicken Sandwich Wars.\n\nRetail sale of sauces\nIn the spring of 2020, Chick-fil-A test-trialed the sale of two of their dipping sauces at some supermarkets in Florida, with all profits earmarked for a scholarship fund for company's store level employees. The trial was considered successful, and distribution was expanded nationwide by 2021. Two more sauces were added  in 2023.In October 2022, the company trialed expansion of the program to include its salad dressings in the Cincinnati metropolitan area and in parts of Tennessee, and expanded nationwide in spring 2023.\n\nCorporate culture\nS. Truett Cathy was a devout Southern Baptist; his religious beliefs had a major impact on the company. The company's official statement of corporate purpose says that the business exists \"To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.\" Cathy opposed the company becoming public for religious and personal reasons.A company spokesperson said in 2012, \"The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our Restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect \u2013regardless of their belief, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender.\"\n\nSunday closing\nIn accordance with the founder's belief in the Christian doctrine of first-day Sabbatarianism, all Chick-fil-A locations are closed on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Cathy said \"Our decision to close on Sunday was our way of honoring God and of directing our attention to things that mattered more than our business.\"In an interview with ABC News's Nightline, Truett's son Dan T. Cathy told reporter Vicki Mabrey that the company is also closed on Sundays because \"by the time Sunday came, he was just worn out. And Sunday was not a big trading day, anyway, at the time. So he was closed that first Sunday and we've been closed ever since. He figured if he didn't like working on Sundays, that other people didn't either.\"Even Chick-fil-A locations at sports stadiums close on Sundays, although many games are played on Sundays.\n\nLenten observance\nDuring the Western Christian liturgical season of Lent, Chick-fil-A has in the past promoted fish sandwiches, following the Christian tradition of abstinence from meat during Lent. They no longer offer this product.\n\nServing chicken without antibiotics\nIn February 2014, Chick-fil-A announced plans to serve chicken raised without antibiotics in its restaurants nationwide within five years, the first fast-food restaurant to make this commitment. This was implemented by May 2019.\n\nRemoval of additives\nIn 2011, food blogger and activist Vani Hari noted that Chick-fil-A sandwiches contained nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil preserved with tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), made from butane. In October 2012, Chick-fil-A invited Hari to meet with company executives at its headquarters. In December 2013, Chick-fil-A said that it was removing high-fructose corn syrup and artificial dyes, and was testing a new peanut oil. Chick-fil-A, like other companies, does not publicly announce such changes unless already in the news, because it focuses attention on these ingredients.\n\nInternational locations\nCanada\nIn September 1994, Chick-fil-A opened its first location outside of the United States inside a student center food court at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This location did not perform very well and was closed within two or three years. The company opened an outlet at the Calgary International Airport in Alberta in May 2014, and closed it in 2019.Chick-fil-A opened a restaurant in Toronto, Ontario, on September 6, 2019, in the Yonge and Bloor Street area. There were protests criticizing the company's violation of animal rights and \"history of supporting anti-LGBTQ causes\". Chick-fil-A announced that it would open two other locations in Toronto during 2019, and 12 additional stores in the Greater Toronto Area over the subsequent five years. The chain's second Toronto location opened at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in January 2020.The company expanded to other areas of Ontario in 2021, opening standalone locations with drive-through restaurants in Kitchener in August, and Windsor in October.\n\nSouth Africa\nIn August 1996, Chick-fil-A opened its first location outside of North America by building a restaurant in Durban, South Africa. A second location was opened in Johannesburg in November 1997. Neither was profitable, and they were closed in 2001.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nA Chick-fil-A operated in Edinburgh during Spring 2018. On October 10, 2019, Chick-fil-A returned to Europe, with the opening of a store at The Oracle shopping centre in Reading, UK. The store closed in March 2020 after The Oracle opted not to continue the lease of the location beyond the six-month pilot period in the face of continued protests over the chain's anti-LGBTQ stance.In February 2019, Chick-fil-A opened a store on a 12-month pilot scheme in Aviemore, Scotland. The store was closed in January 2020 amidst protest and controversy from locals and customers regarding the chain's former donations to charities supporting anti-LGBT rights causes. Chick-Fil-A said that they had always planned a short-term stay at the location.Later the company changed some policies, appointing its first head of diversity, in 2020, and focused its charitable activities on education and hunger alleviation rather than opponents of same-sex marriage. In September 2023 the company said that it planned to open five restaurants in the UK from early 2025, investing over $100m over the following ten years in the UK. The chain said that it would apply its charitable policies, including a $25,000 donation to a local organisation on opening a Chick-fil-A restaurant and donation of surplus food to local charitable causes, to its UK branches too.\n\nExpansion to Asia and Europe\nChick-fil-A CEO Andrew Cathy announced in March 2023 that it planned to open restaurants in both Asia and Europe by 2026, and was set to expand to a total of five overseas markets by 2030. The Wall Street Journal reported that it was seeking countries with \"stable economies, dense populations, and a demand for chicken\".\n\nPlanned locations\nIn July 2018, Chick-fil-A announced it would be opening its first location in Hawaii in Kahului in early 2022, with additional locations in Honolulu and Kapoleo to follow. The first Puerto Rican location opened on March 3, 2022, in Bayam\u00f3n.\n\nAdvertising\n\"Eat Mor Chikin\" is the chain's most prominent advertising slogan, created by The Richards Group in 1995. The slogan is often seen in advertisements, featuring Holstein dairy cows that are often seen wearing (or holding) signs that (usually) read \"Eat Mor Chikin\" in capital letters. The ad campaign was temporarily halted on January 1, 2004, during a mad cow disease scare, so as not to make the chain seem insensitive or appear to be taking advantage of the scare to increase its sales. Two months later, the cows were put up again. The cows replaced the chain's old mascot, Doodles, an anthropomorphized chicken that still appears as the C on the logo.Chick-fil-A vigorously protects its intellectual property, sending cease and desist letters to those they think have infringed on their trademarks. The corporation has successfully protested at least 30 instances of the use of an \"eat more\" phrase, saying that the use would cause confusion of the public, dilute the distinctiveness of their intellectual property, and diminish its value.A 2011 letter to Vermont artist Bo Muller-Moore who screen prints T-shirts reading: \"Eat More Kale\" demanded that he cease printing the shirts and turn over his website. The incident drew criticism from Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, and created backlash against what he termed Chick-fil-A's \"corporate bullying\". On December 11, 2014, Bo Muller-Moore announced that the U.S. Patent Office granted his application to trademark his \"Eat More Kale\" phrase. A formal announcement of his victory took place on December 12, 2014, with Shumlin and other supporters on the Statehouse steps. His public fight drew regional and national attention, the support of Shumlin, and a team of pro-bono law students from the University of New Hampshire legal clinic.After 22 years with The Richards Group, Chick-fil-A switched to McCann New York in 2016. Along with the cows, ads included famous people in history in a campaign called \"Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think.\"\n\nSponsored events\nChick-fil-A Classic\nThe Chick-fil-A Classic is a high school basketball tournament held in Columbia, South Carolina, featuring nationally ranked players and teams. The tournament is co-sponsored by the Greater Columbia Educational Advancement Foundation (GCEAF), which provides scholarships to high school seniors in the greater Columbia area.Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl\nThe Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, first known as the Peach Bowl until 2006 and renamed Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl in 2014, is a college football bowl game played each year in Atlanta, Georgia.Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game\nThe Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game is an annual early-season college football game played at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia; before 2017, it was played at the Georgia Dome. It features two highly ranked teams, one of which has always been from the Southeastern Conference. In the 2012 season and again in the 2014 season, the event was expanded to two games. It was also two games in 2017. On July 12, 2023, Georgia-based insurance company Aflac, became the new sponsor of the game.\n\nControversies\nSame-sex marriage\nChick-fil-A has donated over $5 million, via the WinShape Foundation, to groups that oppose same-sex marriage.  In response, students at several colleges and universities worked to ban or remove the company's restaurants from their campuses.In June and July 2012, Chick-fil-A's chief operating officer Dan T. Cathy made several public statements about same-sex marriage, saying that those who \"have the audacity to define what marriage is about\" were \"inviting God's judgment on our nation\". Several prominent politicians expressed disapproval. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Chicago Alderman Proco \"Joe\" Moreno said they hoped to block franchise expansion into their areas.The proposed bans drew criticism from liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union. The Jim Henson Company, which had a Pajanimals kids' meal toy licensing arrangement with Chick-fil-A, said it would cease its business relationship, and donate the payment to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Chick-fil-A stopped distributing the toys, claiming that unrelated safety concerns had arisen prior to the controversy. Chick-fil-A released a statement on July 31, 2012, saying, \"We are a restaurant company focused on food, service, and hospitality; our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.\"Less than a year after Moreno's comments, Chick-fil-A opened its first restaurant in downtown Chicago.\nIn 2022, ten years after Menino's comments, Chick-fil-A opened its first store in Boston, a 5,280-square-foot restaurant on Boylston Street. At the time of the opening, there were 15 other Chick-fil-A restaurants operating in the greater Boston area.In response to the controversy, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee initiated a Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day movement to counter a boycott of Chick-fil-A launched by same-sex marriage activists. Many of the chain's stores reported record levels of customers that day. The United States Federal Aviation Administration also responded to two cities that were preventing Chick-fil-A from opening in their international airport, citing \"Federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding.\"In April 2018, Chick-fil-A reportedly continued to donate to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes gay marriage. In a November 18, 2019, interview, Chick-fil-A president Tim Tassopoulos said the company would stop donating to The Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\nDrive-through traffic\nThe popularity of Chick-fil-A's drive-throughs in the United States has led to traffic problems, police interventions, and complaints by neighboring businesses in more than 20 states. The long drive-through lines have been reported to cause traffic backups, blocking emergency vehicles and city buses and increasing the risk of collisions and pedestrian injuries.\n\nRelated restaurants\nHapeville Dwarf House\nTruett Cathy opened his first restaurant in 1946, The Dwarf Grill \u2013 later renamed the Dwarf House \u2013 in Hapeville, Georgia, and developed the pressure-cooked chicken breast sandwich there. At the original Chick-fil-A Dwarf Grill, in addition to the full-size entrances, there is also an extra small-sized front door.The original Dwarf House in Hapeville, Georgia is open 24 hours a day, six days a week, except on Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The store closes at 10:00 p.m. on Saturday nights, and the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas and reopens at 6 a.m. on Monday mornings and the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has a larger dine-in menu than the other Dwarf House locations as well as an animated seven dwarfs display in the back of the restaurant. It was across the street from the former Ford Motor Company factory called Atlanta Assembly.\n\nDwarf House\nOpened in 1986, Truett's original, full-service restaurants offer a substantial menu and provide customers a choice of table service, walk-up counter service or a drive-thru window. There are currently five of the original eleven Chick-fil-A Dwarf House restaurants still operating in the metro Atlanta area, including Duluth, Riverdale, Jonesboro, Forest Park and Fayetteville.\n\nTruett's Grill\nIn 1996, the first Truett's Grill was opened in Morrow, Georgia. The second location opened in 2003 in McDonough, Georgia, and a third location opened in 2006 in Griffin, Georgia. Similar to the Chick-fil-A Dwarf Houses, these independently owned restaurants offer traditional, sit-down dining and expanded menu selections in a diner-themed restaurant. In 2017, Chick-fil-A demolished several Dwarf House locations to replace them with Truett's Grill locations.\n\nTruett's Chick-fil-A\nTruett's Chick-fil-A is designed in honor of founder S. Truett Cathy.  The restaurant is decorated with family photos and favorite quotes of the restaurant founder. The restaurant offers drive-thru, counter, and sit-down service for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There are four locations including Newnan, Rome, Stockbridge, and Woodstock, Georgia.\n\nTruett's Luau\nTruett Cathy visited Hawaii;  at the age of 92 he opened Truett's Luau in Fayetteville, Georgia in 2013.  The menu includes island favorites with a southern US spin.   The restaurant offers sit-down, counter and drive-thru service.\n\nSenior leadership\nChick-fil-A has been run by the Cathy family since the restaurant chain's founding in 1946; as of 2021 it was being led by the third generation of the Cathy family.\n\nList of chairmen\nS.

        "body": "\"Chicken Fried\" is a song by American country music group Zac Brown Band, which frontman Zac Brown co-wrote with Wyatt Durrette. The song was first recorded in 2003 for the 2005 album Home Grown. The Lost Trailers, another country group, released their version in 2006 as a single, but it was withdrawn from radio. Two years later, the Zac Brown Band re-recorded the song and released it as the first single from their album The Foundation.\nIn late 2008, \"Chicken Fried\" became the band's first chart single, as well as their first number-one hit on the Billboard country charts. The song has also been placed at number 39 for the Taste of Country's \"Top 100 Country Songs of All Time\" chart. The song was featured in the 2008 comedy film Witless Protection.\n\nHistory\nBrown began co-writing \"Chicken Fried\" with Wyatt Durrette several years before the song's release. The two met when Brown was playing at a tavern in Atlanta, Georgia. According to Country Weekly magazine, Brown had already started the song, when he and Durrette began listing off \"things that are very southern or characteristic of the South to put into this song.\" The song was completed gradually over several years. Following the September 11 attacks, Brown decided to add the third verse, which has a patriotic theme (\"I thank God for my life / For the stars and stripes\u2026\"). Although he had already begun performing the song, he still considered it unfinished until he added a line to the second verse. The patriotic theme and Southern cuisine was the band's inspiration to record this song.\nThe Zac Brown Band first recorded \"Chicken Fried\" in 2003 and later included this version on their self-released 2005 album Home Grown. Later on, in 2006, The Lost Trailers covered the song as their first release for the BNA Records label, with Blake Chancey serving as producer. Although The Lost Trailers' version had entered the country charts, it was soon withdrawn from radio and replaced with \"Call Me Crazy\", as Brown had changed his mind about licensing the song to BNA. \"Call Me Crazy\" then went on to peak at 43 in mid-2006.  In the Nashville episode of Sonic Highways, Zac Brown explained the situation in greater detail:  We had this song Chicken Fried, we put it on a CD in '05.  This band, The Lost Trailers had called and said \"We want to record Chicken Fried.\"  I was like \"Well, I don't have a problem with you recording the song, but this is our song.  As long as you don't release it to radio, if you want to have it on your record, I'm fine with that.\"  Then they get a record deal through Sony with this dude Joe Galante, who like, runs Nashville, basically.  He said \"THAT'S the single.\"  So The first time I hear \"Chicken Fried\" on the radio, it wasn't us singing it.  It was like, my worst nightmare.  So I call my lawyer and was like \"Dude, the fucking song is on the radio,\" and then he says ya know, \"Zac, what's the deal with this?\"  He's like, \"You could get blackballed out of Nashville forever for not letting them record the song.\"  I was like, ya know \"Fuck that, the dude told me he wouldn't fucking do it, and then he did it!\"  So they had to call a cease-and-desist, they pulled it off the radio.  I came to Nashville to play a show at 3rd and Lindsley and there was a dude in there, they were like \"You know who that is?  That's the dude that's had 40 Number 1's with Alan Jackson and he's like the dude, Keith Stegall.  Keith had come out to hear me play. He sat down at the table, and he's like, ya know staring down at his drink and he said \"I had to meet the kid that told Joe Galante to fuck off.\"  And that was the beginning (of our relationship and commercial success).\nIn 2008, the Zac Brown Band re-recorded \"Chicken Fried\" for their fourth album, The Foundation, which Keith Stegall produced. This re-recording was then released in mid-2008 as the band's first single, reaching Number One on the country charts in late 2008.\nIn 2009, Alan Jackson revealed that he was planning to record the song shortly before the Zac Brown Band version was released, but declined because he felt that he had too many other songs that mentioned food.On some radio stations, the lyric \"Turn the radio up\" was changed to say the station name or branding instead. Examples includes KNCI in Sacramento, where the lyric was changed to \"KNCI up\", and stations branded as The Bull, where the lyric was changed to \"Turn The Bull on up\".\n\nCommercial performance\nThe Lost Trailers' version of the song reached as high as #52 on the Hot Country Songs chart in 2006 before being withdrawn as a single. The Zac Brown Band's version made its debut at #59 on the same chart for the week of June 28, 2008, peaking at #1 on the chart week of December 6. This song also made the Zac Brown Band the first country music group to reach Number One with a debut single since Heartland's 2006 Number One hit \"I Loved Her First\". The song reached 4 million in sales in the United States by October 2013. As of July 2017, the song has sold 4,913,000 copies in the United States.An Applebee's TV advertisement featuring this song was aired in CNN while covering Russia\u2019s military deployment across the border of Ukraine the night of February 24, causing controversy. Applebee's eventually pulled its advertising from CNN in response to the incident.\n\nCharts and certifications\nZac Brown Band's version\nThe Lost Trailers version\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Chimaek (\uce58\ub9e5; from Korean  chikin 'fried chicken', and  maekju 'beer') is a pairing of fried chicken (either plain huraideu or spicy yangnyeom) and beer, served as anju (English: food with alcohol) in the evening in many South Korean restaurants, including a number of specialized chains.\n\nOrigin and popularization\nThere is a historic record that indicates a similar recipe has existed in Korea since at least 600 years ago, but which was long forgotten until the late 2010s. Modern chimaek is believed to have been invented in late 20th century, but it is hard to pinpoint the exact time and place. From the roasted chicken that appeared in the early 1960s to the spicy chicken that was adapted to meet Korean tastes, South Korea has imported and developed a growing variety of chicken dishes. While chicken was gaining popularity, a new draft beer which appeared in the 1970s was also becoming very popular, and it became common for the two to be combined as a single menu item. Moreover, the 2002 Korea\u2013Japan World Cup shed more light on the chimaek phenomenon, and the dish has also had a significant impact on Korean drinking culture. Today, fried chicken is one of the most popular dishes in Korea. It's so popular that Koreans created the word Chi-neunim, which is a compound word of chicken and God Haneunim in Korean.The concept of fried chicken was well known in Korea since the early Joseon dynasty as Pogye (\ud3ec\uacc4) as it appeared in the Sangayorok (\uc0b0\uac00\uc694\ub85d) cookbook written in 1459. Chicken production increased 13 times as the nation's economy grew. With the introduction of cooking oil in Korea in 1971, chicken and oil were plentiful, which created an environment where people could eat more chicken. At this time, chicken and beer were sold together, which eventually led to the creation of chimaek. In the 1970s, manufacturing workers paid 3,400 South Korean won per chicken, but the price of a boiled chicken was \u20a92,500, and 500 cc (18 imp fl oz; 17 US fl oz) of beer was \u20a9450.In 1977, the chicken brand Rims Archived 15 September 2018 at the Wayback Machine Chicken was founded. It was quite strange for Koreans to chop and fry chicken, but its popularity was enormous, especially around the holiday seasons.The word chicken and beer were not used in conjunction until 2002 with the Korea\u2013Japan World Cup. Public parks would often have large screens to watch the games, and people would dress in red (the colour and nickname of the home team) and gather together to cheer for the World Cup, while eating chicken and drinking beer. The number of chicken restaurants increased from around 10,000 to 25,000 after the World Cup.Chimaek Street is planned to be built in Gimpo, South Korea. There is a prospect that various chicken restaurants will be gathered in one place and that world beer and various kinds of chicken will be a specialty of Gimpo city.There are many chimaek festivals in Korea, including the Seoul Chimaek Festival which is held in mid-October in downtown Seoul. It is an event to promote Korean food culture abroad by combining chicken and beer. In Daegu Metropolitan City, a chimaek festival was held in 2013. In 2013, a chimaek festival in Ningbo, China, drew some 400,000 visitors in its first three days.\n\nSports\nChimaek is popular choice for people watching sports events such as World Cup and Asian Cup Especially, Convenience stores and fried chicken franchises enjoying a busy season during the World Cup.\n\nOutside Korea\nChina\nChimaek is also popular in China because of the popular drama My Love From the Star, in which Cheon Song-i, the heroine, said \"A snowy day is just perfect for our Chimaek time ...\"; which triggered the phenomenon. Specialty chicken shops have been more numerous in China. Uploading pictures of oneself holding a chicken in one hand and a beer in the other on social networks became a trend.Since December 2014, Chinese people have been willing to wait an average of three hours in front of a Korean-brand chimaek shop to enjoy the food. At the time of the drama's airing, thousands of \"Chicken Mac sets\" were sold in Hangzhou, and Lotte Mart in China offered a 25 percent discount for a chicken and six cans of Tsingtao beer.\n\nNew Zealand\nThe 2023 Oakland's Annual Chimaek Festival was held in Auckland, New Zealand's capital.\n\nRestaurants\nDemand for specialty chicken shops increased with the growing demands for chicken and beer. As of March 2014, Korea had 192 chicken franchise companies. About 10% of companies are known for unique recipes.\n\nSee also\nList of chicken dishes\nAnju (food)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Coon Chicken Inn was an American chain of three restaurants that was founded by Maxon Lester Graham and Adelaide Burt in 1925, which prospered until the late 1950s. The restaurant's name contained the word Coon, considered a racial slur, and the trademarks and entrances of the restaurants were designed to look like a smiling caricature of an African American porter. The smiling capped porter head also appeared on menus, dishes, and promotional items. Due to changes in popular culture and the general consideration of being culturally and racially offensive, the chain was closed by 1957.The first Coon Chicken Inn was opened in suburban Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1925. In 1929, another restaurant was opened in then-suburban Lake City, Seattle, and a third was opened in the Hollywood District of Portland, Oregon, in 1931. A fourth location was advertised but never opened in Spokane, Washington. Later, a cabaret, orchestra, and catering were added to the Seattle and Salt Lake restaurants. The Portland location at 5474 NE Sandy Blvd. closed in 1949 and was converted into another restaurant, and is currently the location of Clyde's Prime Rib. The Seattle location also closed in 1949 and is no longer standing. That address at 8500 Lake City Way is now occupied by The Growler Guys restaurant. The Salt Lake City location at 2960 S. (sometimes listed as 2950 S.) Highland Drive closed in 1957 and is now the site of a furniture store.\n\nPopular culture\nAn antique promotional poster for Coon Chicken Inn featured as a plot device in the 2001 black comedy film Ghost World.The company plays a role in the alternate history mockumentary C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America from 2004. It is featured in a number of advertisements, and is believed to have heavily outperformed its real life counterpart. It is implied to have replaced McDonald's and KFC as North America's most known fast food establishment.\n\nSee also\nSambo's restaurant chain\nList of chicken restaurants\nList of defunct restaurants of the United States\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "The KFC Original Recipe is a secret mix of ingredients that fast food restaurant chain, KFC uses to produce fried chicken.\nBy the very late 1930s, Harland Sanders' gas station in Corbin, Kentucky was so well known for its fried chicken that Sanders decided to remove the gas pumps and build a restaurant and motel in their place. While perfecting his secret recipe with 11 herbs and spices, Sanders found that pan frying chicken was too slow, requiring 30 minutes per order. Deep frying the chicken required half the time but produced dry, unevenly done chicken. In 1939, he found that using a pressure fryer produced tasty, moist chicken in eight or nine minutes. By July 1940, Sanders finalized what came to be known as his Original Recipe.After Sanders formed a partnership with Pete Harman, they began marketing the chicken in the 1950s as Kentucky Fried Chicken; the company shipped the spices already mixed to restaurants to preserve the recipe's secrecy. He claimed that the ingredients \"stand on everybody's shelf\".Sanders used vegetable oil for frying chicken. By 1993, for economic reasons, many KFC outlets had chosen to use a blend of palm and soybean oil. In Japan, the oil used is mainly the more expensive cottonseed and corn oil, as KFC Japan believes that this offers superior taste quality.\n\nHistory\nSanders' Original Recipe of \"11 herbs and spices\" is one of the most famous trade secrets in the catering industry. Franchisee Dave Thomas, better known as the founder of Wendy's, argued that the secret recipe concept was successful because \"everybody wants in on a secret\" and former KFC owner John Y. Brown, Jr. called it \"a brilliant marketing ploy.\" The New York Times described the recipe as one of the company's most valuable assets. The recipe is not patented, because patents are published in detail and come with an expiration date, whereas trade secrets can remain the intellectual property of their holders in perpetuity.KFC uses its Original Recipe as a means to differentiate its product from its competitors. Early franchisee Pete Harman credited the chain's popularity to the recipe and the product, and John Y. Brown cites the \"incredibly tasty, almost addictive\" product as the basis of KFC's staying power. On the other hand, Allen Adamson, managing director of brand consultancy Landor, remains unconvinced about the contribution of the secret formula aspect. He argues: \"The story may still be part of these companies' folklore, but I'd be surprised if more than 2 percent buy the brand because of it.\"\n\nRecipes\nA copy of the recipe, signed by Sanders, is stored within a vault at KFC's Louisville headquarters, along with 11 separate vials that each contain one of the ingredients. KFC employs two different firms, Griffith Laboratories and McCormick & Company, to formulate the blend; in order to maintain secrecy, each firm is given a different half of the recipe. Once the Griffith portion has been formulated, it is sent to McCormick and combined with the remaining ingredients there.In 1983, William Poundstone conducted laboratory research into the coating mix, as described in his book Big Secrets, and claimed that a sample he examined contained only flour, salt, monosodium glutamate and black pepper. KFC maintains that it still adheres to Sanders' original 1940 recipe. In Todd Wilbur's television program Top Secret Recipe, Sanders's former secretary, Shirley Topmiller, revealed that Sanders learned from his mother that sage and savory are good seasonings for chicken. Also, Winston Shelton, a former friend of Sanders, said that the secret recipe contains Tellicherry black pepper.It is well attested that Harland Sanders asked Bill Summers of Marion-Kay Spices in Brownstown, Indiana, US to recreate his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. Sanders recommended the Marion-Kay seasoning to franchisees over the corporate version, as he believed the latter had been made inferior by the corporation's inattention. Following Sanders' passing, KFC sued Marion-Kay in 1982, and the latter was forbidden from selling its mixture to KFC franchises as a result. The Marion-Kay seasoning is still sold under the name \"99-X,\" and according to Sanders biographer Josh Ozersky, it is indistinguishable from the original KFC recipe.\n\nJoe Ledington\nIn August 2016, the Chicago Tribune reported that Joe Ledington of Kentucky, a nephew by marriage of Colonel Sanders, had claimed to have found a copy of the original KFC fried chicken recipe on a handwritten piece of paper in an envelope in a scrapbook. Tribune staffers conducted a cooking test of this recipe, which took several attempts to get right. They had to determine whether the \"Ts\" meant tablespoons or teaspoons.  If tablespoons, the resulting mix would be 32% spice, 68% breading.  If teaspoons, the mix would be 12.5% spice, 87.5% breading.\nAfter some trial and error, they decided the chicken should be soaked in buttermilk and coated once in the breading mixture, then fried in oil at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) in a pressure fryer until golden brown. As a pressure fryer was too big, a deep fryer was used alternatively as a substitute. They also claimed that with the addition of MSG as a flavor enhancer, they could produce fried chicken which tasted \"indistinguishable\" from fried chicken that they had purchased at KFC.The recipe found by Joe Ledington reads as follows:\n11 Spices \u2013 Mix with 2 cups white flour\n\n2\u20443 t salt\n1\u20442 t thyme\n1\u20442 t basil\n1\u20443 t oregano\n1 t celery salt\n1 t black pepper\n1 t  dry mustard\n4 t paprika\n2 t garlic salt\n1 t ground ginger\n3 t white pepperWhile Ledington expressed uncertainty that the recipe was the Original Recipe, he had a hand in mixing the Original Recipe for Colonel Sanders when he was a young boy, and recalled that white pepper was a principal ingredient.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Lemon pepper wings are unbreaded chicken wings coated in lemon pepper seasoning. The dish was invented in Miami, Florida, and is considered to be emblematic of the cuisines of both Miami and Atlanta.\n\nHistory\nLemon pepper wings were invented in Miami, Florida, where people began adding lemon pepper to buffalo wings to reduce their spiciness. Wings which came dressed in lemon pepper seasoning later became popular at the city's restaurants. Another reason for the popularity of lemon pepper wings in the early 2000s may have been the fact that they were less likely to stain clothes than buffalo wings, and were preferred by rappers who commonly wore white t-shirts at the time.The dish is strongly associated with Atlanta cuisine. Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms commented that \"Lemon pepper wings are Atlanta\" in 2017. In 2022, Eric Kim of The New York Times wrote that \"in Atlanta, lemon pepper is queen\" and described the wings as \"central to [the city's] social fabric.\"The wings have inspired various items such as lemon pepper tacos, french fries, pierogies, pizza, beer, and soda.Lemon pepper wings are frequently served in the city's strip clubs. Chris Kirschner of The Athletic observed that high-quality food was often a hallmark of Atlanta strip clubs, particularly wings, and their food was known to draw celebrity guests. It is also served throughout the United States by chain restaurants.\n\nDescription\nThe dish is prepared by frying or roasting unbreaded chicken wings. After cooking, they are tossed in lemon pepper, a seasoning made with lemon zest and black pepper as well as other ingredients such as sugar. Many recipes use premade lemon pepper.\n\nLemon pepper wet\n\"Lemon pepper wet\" is a variation in which the wings are coated in a sauce. They may be tossed in a lemon sauce instead of a dry rub. This version of the dish was invented at the American Deli in Atlanta. Other versions of this dish involve coating the wings with butter or buffalo sauce and tossing them in dry lemon pepper seasoning.\n\nIn popular culture\nLemon pepper wings are commonly referenced in music and television related to Atlanta. The 2 Chainz song \"Hot Wings\" (2018) includes the verse \"She just want her 20-piece/ All flats with the lemon pepper\". They are mentioned in the Drake song \"Lemon Pepper Freestyle\" (2021) featuring Rick Ross. Ross, who owns several Wingstop locations, has mentioned them in numerous other songs including \"Buy Back the Block\", \"Dope Dick\", \"U.O.E.N.O.\" and \"Thug Cry\". They have also been mentioned in songs by rappers like Gucci Mane and the group Migos.They appeared in the second episode of the television series Atlanta, in which a character receives \"lemon pepper wet\" wings from the real life restaurant J.R. Crickets. The scene went viral on social media and popularized the dish online. At the time, \"lemon pepper wet\" wings were not on the restaurant's menu although they had a similar dish called \"Fester\" wings which customers frequently referred to as \"lemon pepper wet\". The \"lemon pepper wet\" depicted in the show was actually inspired by a dish served at the American Deli, a different restaurant in Atlanta. Writer Stephen Glover explained that he wanted the character to be \"hooked up\" by receiving an item that was not on the menu at J.R. Crickets. In 2017, J.R. Crickets added \"lemon pepper wet\" to the menu in honor of the show. Mike Jordan of Eater Atlanta claimed that the episode had popularized the dish.In 2020, Lou Williams of the Los Angeles Clippers was nicknamed \"Lemon Pepper Lou\" on social media when it was reported that he ordered lemon pepper wings with Jack Harlow at the Magic City strip club during a trip outside the NBA Bubble. Williams was previously known for frequenting the club to purchase its wings, where the dish \"Louwill Lemon Pepper BBQ Wings\" was named after him. He objected to the nickname but later trademarked it.\n\nSee also\nHot chicken\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Maryland Fried Chicken is a group of independently owned restaurants and former corporate chain of franchised fried chicken take-out restaurants that originated in Orlando, Florida. It was founded by Al Constantine in 1961 and grew to cover some 20 U.S. states and the Bahamas at its peak before ultimately going bankrupt in the late 1970s and dissolving as a chain.\n\nNomenclature\nThe name \"Maryland Fried Chicken\" was chosen due to the then-recent opening of a Glenn L. Martin Co. manufacturing plant in Orlando. Martin had previously built an aircraft manufacturing facility near Baltimore, Maryland that at one time was the largest such facility in the world. A number of Baltimore natives came with the company to its new Orlando facility and frequented Constantine's Restaurant; thus, the \"Maryland\" name was devised to appeal to these customers. This is despite the fact that Al Constantine's recipe was dissimilar to traditional Chicken Maryland, that he originally hailed from Delaware, and that the chain was founded in Florida.\n\nHistory\nBackground and early history\nAl Constantine, a 2nd generation immigrant from Italy, originally lived in Wilmington, Delaware, where he and his family operated \"The Dinner Bell\" restaurant that his father had founded. Gradually, the Constantine family moved to Orlando, Florida and opened a new 24-hour diner called Constantine's Restaurant in 1959. In 1960, members of the family noticed the popularity of an early Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise in Florida and set out to compete with them. Al Constantine experimented with fried chicken recipes and settled on a blend of 21 herbs and spices for the breading mix, while cooking the chicken in pure peanut oil using a pressure fryer. After handing out free samples for some time to gauge customer reactions, Al's \"Maryland Fried Chicken\" was added to the menu at Constantine's Restaurant and a 35-foot sign advertising the new product was erected outside the diner.The first restaurant to operate solely under the name Maryland Fried Chicken opened in Fern Park, Florida as a joint venture between Al Constantine and a business partner, W. H. Truesdell. This new restaurant opened on October 4, 1961, and featured a limited menu in contrast to the wider offerings of Constantine's Restaurant. Additional MFC locations opened thereafter under franchise agreements.\n\nFirst incorporation\nMaryland Fried Chicken was incorporated in the state of Florida on Feb. 15th, 1963. Al Constantine acted as president of the corporation; his brother Richard was treasurer; his brother Angelo \"Angel\" was vice president; and their parents served as directors. The chain grew to 55 units by October 1967, all in the state of Florida. Al Constantine was actively pursuing avenues of expansion to other states as well as internationally; he had conducted an \"extensive market feasibility study\" in multiple Western European nations and MFC, Inc. was working with prospective franchisees in the states of Georgia and Alabama.\n\nMaryland Fried Chicken of America\nMaryland Fried Chicken, Inc. was approached by Georgia businessman J. R. Miller in 1967 with an offer of $100,000 to become the national franchising agent for MFC. With this deal, a new company called Maryland Fried Chicken of America, Inc. was established as a subsidiary of Miller's own business, First Macon Corporation. MFC of America would spearhead the restaurant chain's nationwide expansion program, while Al Constantine's Maryland Fried Chicken, Inc. would continue to operate independently and manage the extant restaurants in Florida. MFC of America made a \"firm commitment\" upon signing the deal to open a minimum of 500 outlets nationally within five years.The first franchises to open under Maryland Fried Chicken of America were operational in Georgia, Alabama, and Michigan by the end of 1967. Over the following two years, MFC of America established a national headquarters in Macon, Georgia, complete with a franchise training college, and negotiated hundreds of franchise agreements across a dozen U.S. states. In 1969, Maryland Fried Chicken claimed to be the third-largest and fastest-growing fried chicken take-out chain in the United States.\n\nSecond Incorporation and Downfall\nBy late 1969, Florida-based Maryland Fried Chicken, Inc. and Georgia-based Maryland Fried Chicken of America, Inc. were in talks to merge. At the time, MFC, Inc. operated 67 units in Florida and Louisiana and MFC of America operated 49 units across many states; the combined company would have 116 locations across 16 states with 134 additional franchises pending construction. First Macon Corp. would pay $1.3 million and own 40% of the combined company. Al Constantine and J. R. Miller jointly announced that the merger had been completed on Feb. 23rd, 1970, and the resulting company was a Delaware-based firm called Maryland Fried Chicken, Inc. that maintained executive offices in Macon, GA. Al Constantine remained president of the firm, while his brother, Angelo, and mother, Rose, each became a vice president, and J. R. Miller became chairman.Following the merger, Maryland Fried Chicken began offering franchises in new regions including New England. By early 1971, the chain boasted 160 locations. However, Al Constantine stepped down as president of the company in 1971 as financial problems forced dozens of store closures; by late 1972, only 102 stores remained, though the new president of MFC, Alan Parker, claimed then that the business had returned to profitability. Nevertheless, as the 1970s Recession was ongoing, MFC, Inc. suffered a number of legal defeats stemming from unpaid loans, and ultimately the company dissolved in 1979 following a bankruptcy filing.\n\nSuccessor Entities\nFollowing the dissolution of MFC, Inc., the remaining franchises began to operate independently. In addition to the remaining MFC-branded franchises, a few distinct successor businesses emerged:\n\nThe Shrimper Seafood & Maryland Fried Chicken is a combination of Maryland Fried Chicken and The Shrimper Seafood, both pre-existing restaurant chains. The first combined location opened in 1976 in a former MFC restaurant in Florence, South Carolina. At present, the chain has 4 locations, all in South Carolina.\nMr. C's Southern Fried Chicken was founded in 1979 by Al Constantine in a former Maryland Fried Chicken restaurant in Sanford, Florida. Constantine claimed that MFC had changed the chicken recipe after he left the company, and that Mr. C's would offer his original recipe, with the intent to open additional locations. Constantine later sold the restaurant, which then closed following a 1988 armed robbery that left its new owner stabbed to death.\nThe Original Maryland Fried Chicken was trademarked by Edith Swain, the owner of a MFC restaurant in Waycross, Georgia, in 1997. This occurred after Al Constantine assigned his entire interest in his Maryland Fried Chicken federal trademark registration to Swain in 1995. Today, there are two stores doing business as \"The Original Maryland Fried Chicken.\"\nOriginal Maryland Fried Chicken is a chain of modern MFC restaurants in Florida, founded in 2005 by Bob Costantine with the written blessing of his uncle, Al Constantine. Bob is also the owner of an OMFC-branded restaurant in Apopka, Florida, while his brothers Mike and Tony Costantine own an OMFC franchise in Leesburg, Florida. Although there were previously several other OMFC locations, only the two aforementioned ones remain.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Los Pollos Hermanos (Spanish pronunciation: [los \u02c8po.\u029dos e\u027e.\u02c8ma.nos]; or Spanish pronunciation: [los \u02c8po.\u028eos e\u027e.\u02c8ma.nos] (non-ye\u00edsta), English: The Chicken Brothers) is a fictional fast food restaurant chain specializing in chicken that was featured in the television series Breaking Bad and its spin-off Better Call Saul. In the fictional universe of Breaking Bad, Los Pollos Hermanos is featured as a front organization for Gus Fring's methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution operation, but is also highly regarded by the general public of the Southwest as a regional chain on par with KFC. The set used for the restaurant's Albuquerque location in the show was at a Twisters branch in South Valley, New Mexico, and Twisters has seen an increase in business attributed to being associated with Breaking Bad. Due to the show's popularity, Los Pollos Hermanos has appeared on numerous occasions as a real-life pop-up restaurant. The real life restaurant serves the same menu items as in the show.\n\nIn-universe history\nLos Pollos Hermanos was founded by Chilean nationals and business partners Gus Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito) and Max Arciniega (James Martinez) in Mexico. An apocryphal story as told in a fictional television commercial suggests that it was inspired by recipes cooked by Gus' uncles. Eventually, Gus emigrated to the United States and opened branches primarily in New Mexico, and the chain grew to have 14 locations throughout the American Southwest. Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the Mexico\u2013United States border. A large chicken farm for Los Pollos Hermanos at the outskirts of Albuquerque served as a front where the incoming meth was processed and shipped to the various stores and other destinations. Fring kept the restaurants themselves clean of any business related to drugs.\nThe company eventually became a subsidiary of a fictional German shipping conglomerate, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, whose connections Fring used to further increase the outreach of both his legal and illegal operations. After Fring's death at the hands of Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis), the chain was closed, with the flagship restaurant in Albuquerque being replaced with a Twisters (the same restaurant which is used as the filming set in real-life).\n\nReal-life history\nWhile Breaking Bad was still being aired in 2013, Twisters claimed to have received a 10% increase in revenue due to its association with Breaking Bad.In 2014, a Cook County, Illinois man was arrested and charged with several crimes including the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and wore a Los Pollos Hermanos shirt in his mugshot. Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan revealed on a 2015 Reddit AMA that there were talks at Sony to make Los Pollos Hermanos into a real restaurant.The logo for Los Pollos Hermanos was created in 2008 by Mexican artist Humberto Puentes-Segura. Topanga Productions, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures, the producer of Breaking Bad, began selling merchandise including T-shirts and hats displaying the Los Pollos Hermanos logo. In 2016, Puentes-Segura sued Sony Pictures and Topanga Productions, claiming he did not permit Sony to license or sell merchandise using the logo.In 2017 Los Pollos Hermanos opened as a series of pop-up restaurants across several cities. It was announced to open from April 9\u201310 in New York City on Pearl Street, although the pop-up only offered curly fries and not chicken at all, possibly to avoid NYC Health violations. It also appeared in Los Angeles on April 10\u201311, and Austin, Texas for South by Southwest. On April 11\u201312, a pop-up event occurred at Thirsty Bird in Potts Point, New South Wales, with Giancarlo Esposito making a visit on the first day. Netflix, the international distributor for the series, also organized two separate pop-up events in Italy on May 12\u201313 at real fried chicken restaurants in Rome and Milan which were decorated to look like Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants.In 2017, the Los Pollos Hermanos Employee Training miniseries was released as a promo for Better Call Saul Season 3. It won the award for Short Form Comedy or Drama Series at the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.On January 20, 2018, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the beginning of Breaking Bad, the Twisters location used to film the restaurant on the show was temporarily renovated for a single day to look like Los Pollos Hermanos. The occasion was paid for by \"superfans\" Edward Candelaria and Marq Smith, and was allegedly unsanctioned by Sony Pictures or AMC. The event also coincided with the beginning of filming for Better Call Saul Season 4, and several Breaking Bad cast members, including Ian Posada (Brock Cantillo) and Jeremiah Bitsui (Victor), appeared at the event.In August 2018, Postmates offered a limited-time delivery service for Los Pollos Hermanos in Los Angeles and New York City.In late 2019 the \"Breaking Bad Experience\" pop-up restaurant operated on 7100 Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California, and included items reminiscent of Los Pollos Hermanos. A few days later, it was announced that delivery kitchen network Family Style Inc. partnered with Sony Pictures Consumer Products and began being offering Los Pollos Hermanos through Uber Eats in select markets, starting with Los Angeles. A pop-up location in Venice Beach, California also opened on October 24, 2019 for the premiere of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.The food court at the University of Aberdeen features a fried chicken outlet with Los Pollos Hermanos branding.\n\nSee also\nBubba Gump Shrimp Company, restaurant inspired by characters from Forrest Gump\nBig Kahuna Burger, a fictional burger chain featured in films created by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez\nMel's Diner, a fictional restaurant featured in the TV show Alice\nThe Double R Diner, a fictional restaurant featured in the TV show Twin Peaks\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLos Pollos Hermanos",

        "body": "Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., also known as Popeyes ( POP-yze) and formerly named Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken & Biscuits, is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants formed in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. As of 2021, Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants, which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide. About 50 locations are company-owned; the vast remainder are franchised.\n\nHistory\nPopeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as \"Chicken on the Run\". Owner Al Copeland (1944\u20132008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken, but his restaurant failed after several months. Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken. By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken. Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985. B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church's, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland's creditors that resulted in the creation of America's Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church's. AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479. On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church's to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods & Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&S for a yearly 'spice royalty', before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.\n\nAcquisition by Restaurant Brands International\nOn February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion. On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.\n\nName\nAlvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film The French Connection, which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip  character Popeye the Sailor.However, the company's early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the Popeye & Pals children's show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years. In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.The name is spelled \"Popeyes\", without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald's and Hardee's. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was \"too poor\" to afford an apostrophe.\n\nProducts\nPopeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni & cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entr\u00e9es such as shrimp and catfish. On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end. On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets. For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered \"Sweet and Crunchy\" chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading. In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.\n\nChicken sandwich\nPopeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A's similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes. The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes' Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald's, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy's. Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich. The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch. Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines, and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich. Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks. On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country. One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be \"hustled out of money\", making Popeyes guilty of \"false advertising\" along with \"deceptive business practices\". On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.\nPopeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread. A single sandwich contains 700 calories, 42 grams of fat, 14 grams of saturated fat, 1443 milligrams of sodium, and 28 net grams of protein.In September 2020, Popeyes' chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.\n\nStyle and marketing\nThe restaurants' exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark \"Love That Chicken\" jingle sung by New Orleans funk and R&B musician Dr. John.\nIn 2009, Popeyes introduced \"Annie the Chicken Queen\", a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry. The character is meant to be \"honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic\" according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. \"Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that's what Annie is all about\", Lynch said.Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races, while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season. In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway, and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year's Truck Series season finale at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway.Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably \"Love that chicken from Popeyes\".\n\nInternational franchises\nSome international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.\nPopeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor; it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019. Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020, and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico and the United Kingdom, with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021. Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.\nIn December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022. Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested \u00a350 million into Popeyes UK. In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year.\n\nSee also\nCheryl Bachelder\nList of fast-food chicken restaurants\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Popeyes at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website\nPopeyes Chicken & Biscuits at the Wayback Machine (archived November 11, 1998)\nMenuMasters 1999 Award: \"Best Menu/Line Extension: Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits at the Wayback Machine (archived November 1, 2003)\nBeignets Popeyes Recipe Archived March 2, 2021, at the Wayback Machine",

        "body": "Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken is an American fast food restaurant, formerly a restaurant chain, developed in 1968 and operating multiple locations into the 1970s. The chain sought to capitalize on the popularity of the cartoon character Yogi Bear, and the growing market for fast food fried chicken spawned by the success of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nOrigin and development\nIn the late 1960s, South Carolina restaurant entrepreneur Eugene Broome developed a honey-flavored chicken tenderizer, which became locally popular, leading Broome to open several restaurants. Broome initially wanted to name the restaurant after actor Jackie Gleason, with the intent of competing with Minnie Pearl's Fried Chicken, but Gleason declined the offer. Nonetheless, when the theme was changed, Broome retained as a motto one of Gleason's catchphrases from the TV series The Honeymooners, \"How sweet it is!\" After Gleason's rejection, Broome happened to see Yogi Bear on television, and contacted Hanna Barbera merchandising supervisor Ed Justin, who was willing to license the character, which led to the branding of the chain as Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken. Coincidentally, the character of Yogi Bear was said to have been inspired by the character of Gleeson's costar on The Honeymooners, Art Carney's Ed Norton.In January 1968, the Hardee's restaurant company paid $1 million to form a partnership with Broome for the licensing and operation of the chain. Despite having purchased the chain, \"the branded stores were largely neglected\" by Hardee's. By 1971, one magazine noted that \"[w]hile hamburgers go fast, the company has had less success with a fried chicken entry. In fact, the Yogi Bear Honey Fried Chicken outlets (there are eleven now in the Southeast and Midwest) have been a bomb since the start in early 1968\". The following year, another magazine described the effort as a \"snafu\" on Hardee's part, noting that \"[t]he venture was wrong on two counts: the Yogi Bear image appeals to children but fried chicken is an adult item\".\n\nDecline and aftermath\nAs of 1972, the company reported that \"[p]lans are being made to change the Yogi Bear operations and in the interim there is no expansion of outlets\". However, \"[l]ike so many of the franchised cartoon restaurant chains, Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken had flown the coop by the early 1970s, leaving abandoned buildings in its wake\". The second-to-last location closed in the late 1970s.As the restaurants closed, a number of large fiberglass statues of Yogi Bear and other franchise characters that had been made for the restaurants were bought by the operator of a \"Jellystone Park\"-themed campground in North Carolina, and were later dumped on vacant land near Interstate 95 near Halifax, North Carolina. The statue graveyard became an unintentional tourist attraction, until it was razed in 2008 for new construction at the site. As of 2023, a single Yogi Bear's Honey Fried Chicken venue remained in operation, in Hartsville, South Carolina.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Yaki udon (\u713c\u304d\u3046\u3069\u3093, \"fried udon\") is a Japanese stir-fried dish consisting of thick, smooth, white udon noodles mixed with a soy-based sauce, meat (usually pork), and vegetables. It is similar to yakisoba, which involves a similar stir-frying technique using ramen-style wheat noodles. Yaki udon is relatively simple to make and popular as a staple of Japan's izakaya, or pubs, eaten as a late-night snack. The dish originated in Kokura, in southern Japan, after the Pacific War. The widely accepted story of how the dish was created dates back to just after World War II, when food was scarce. The owner of the noodle restaurant Darumado used udon noodles in popular yakisoba preparations, because the proper noodles were not available.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Yakisoba (Japanese: \u713c\u304d\u305d\u3070, [jaki\ua71csoba], transl.\u2009'fried noodle'), is a Japanese noodle stir-fried dish. Usually, soba noodles are made from buckwheat flour, but soba in yakisoba are Chinese-style noodles (chuuka soba) made from wheat flour, typically flavored with a condiment similar to Worcestershire sauce. The dish first appeared in food stalls in Japan around the 1930s.\n\nPreparation\nYakisoba is prepared by frying ramen-style wheat noodles with bite-sized pork and finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, onions, bean sprouts, and carrots. It is then flavored with Japanese-style Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. It can be served with a variety of garnishes, such as aonori (seaweed powder), beni sh\u014dga (shredded pickled ginger), katsuobushi (bonito fish flakes), or Japanese-style mayonnaise.\n\nServing\nYakisoba can be served on a plate either as a main dish or a side dish.\nIn Japan, noodles piled into a bun sliced down the middle and garnished with mayonnaise and shreds of red pickled ginger are called yakisoba-pan (pan meaning \"bread\") and are commonly available at convenience stores and school canteens.Sometimes udon is used as a replacement for the ramen-style noodles and called yaki udon.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nChow mein \u2013 Chinese stir-fried noodles\nTeppanyaki \u2013 a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook foods such as yakisoba\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Yangzhou fried rice, also known by several other spellings and names, is a popular Chinese wok-fried rice dish. There are many varieties but it most properly describes egg fried rice with mixed vegetables and two forms of protein, typically pork and shrimp with scallions.\n\nNames\nYangzhou fried rice is a calque of the Chinese name written \u63da\u5dde\u7092\u98ef in traditional characters or \u626c\u5dde\u7092\u996d in simplified ones, pronounced Y\u00e1ngzh\u014du ch\u01ceof\u00e0n in Mandarin or \tjoeng4 zau1 caau2 faan6 in Cantonese. Although it did not originate there, it is named for Yangzhou, an ancient city at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal in eastern China. \"Yangzhou\" is the pinyin romanization devised in the 1950s and very gradually introduced across the rest of the world. The dish is also frequently known as Yangchow fried rice from the same name's Postal Map form and as Yeung Chow fried rice from irregular romanization of its Cantonese pronunciation. Although the name properly approximates /j\u0251\u014bd\u0292o\u028a/ in English, /j\u00e6\u014bt\u0283au/ is also common for the older spelling and /ju\u014b.t\u0283au/ for the Cantonese spelling. \nThe same dish is also known in the UK as \"special fried rice\" and in Australia and New Zealand as \"combination fried rice\". Less often, it is known in the United States as \"house fried rice\".\n\nIngredients\nThe difference between Yangzhou fried rice and ordinary fried rice is that Yangzhou style invariably includes a combination of proteins. Rather than using a single protein like shrimp or pork or chicken as the dominant ingredient in fried rice, Yangzhou uses a variety. Most commonly used is a combination of pork and shrimp; roasted or boiled chicken and duck are also found. Ordinarily, some of its staple items include:\nRice\nEgg\nDiced Chinese-style roast pork (char siu)\nShrimp\nChopped scallions, including the green end\nVegetables such as Chinese broccoli (gai lan), carrots, peas, corn, and bamboo shootsThe peas may be a replacement or an addition for the green onions. Some recipes include Shaoxing wine. Some western Chinese restaurants also use soy sauce to flavor the rice, and add meat such as chicken.\n\nHistory\nYangzhou fried rice was first popularized by the Qing official Yi Bingshou (t \u4f0a\u79c9\u7dac, s \u4f0a\u79c9\u7ef6, Y\u012b B\u01d0ngsh\u00f2u; 1754\u20131815), who had previously been the prefect of Yangzhou and is also traditionally credited for Yi mein. Still, there have been attempts by people in Yangzhou to patent the dish.In October 2015, as part of the 2,500th anniversary of the town of Yangzhou, an attempt was made in Yangzhou at beating the previous world record for fried rice set in 2014 by the Turkey culinary federation. The attempt, made by the World Association of Chinese Cuisine resulted in 4,192 kilograms (9,242 lb) of Yangzhou fried rice being produced by a team of 300 cooks. The organizers initially planned to send the end product to five companies for consumption by their staff. However, about 150 kilograms (330 lb) of it ended up as pig swill, as it had been cooked for four hours and was felt unsuitable for human consumption. As per the organizers' intents, the rest was sent to local canteens. However, due to a part of it being sent to feed animals, the world record attempt was disqualified, as a Guinness World Records spokesman said that it had become obvious that the dish was not fit for human consumption.\n\nSee also\nList of Chinese dishes\nList of fried rice dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Couscous (Arabic: \u0643\u064f\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0633, romanized: kuskus) is a traditional North African dish of small steamed granules of rolled semolina that is often served with a stew spooned on top. Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.:\u200a18\u200aCouscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya.:\u200a250\u200a It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century, through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.\n\nEtymology\nThe word \"couscous\" (alternately cuscus or kuskus) was first noted in early 17th century French, from Arabic kuskus, from kaskasa 'to pound', and is probably of Berber origin. The term seksu is attested in various Berber dialects such as Kabyle and Rifain, while Saharan Berber dialects such as Touareg and Ghadames have a slightly different form, keskesu. This widespread geographical dispersion of the term strongly suggests its local Berber origin, lending further support to its likely Berber roots as Algerian linguist Salem Chaker suggests.The Berber root *KS means \"well formed, well rolled, rounded.\" Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world.:\u200a919\n\nHistory\nIt is unclear when couscous originated. Food historian Lucie Bolens believes couscous originated millennia ago, during the reign of Masinissa in the ancient kingdom of Numidia in present-day Algeria. Traces of cooking vessels akin to couscoussiers have been found in graves from the 3rd century BC, from the time of the berber kings of Numidia, in the city of Tiaret, Algeria. Couscoussiers dating back to the 12th century were found in the ruins of Igiliz, located in the Sous valley of Morocco.According to food writer Charles Perry, couscous originated among the Berbers of Algeria and Morocco between the end of the 11th-century Zirid dynasty, modern-day Algeria, and the rise of the 13th-century Almohad Caliphate. The historian Hady Idris noted that couscous is attested to during the Hafsid dynasty, but not the Zirid dynasty.In the 12th century, Maghrebi cooks were preparing dishes of non-mushy grains by stirring flour with water to create light, round balls of couscous dough that could be steamed.The historian Maxime Rodinson found three recipes for couscous from the 13th century Arabic cookbook Kitab al-Wusla ila al-Habib, written by an Ayyubid author, and the anonymous Arabic cooking book Kitab al tabikh and Ibn Razin al-Tujibi's Fadalat al-khiwan also contain recipes.Couscous is believed to have been spread among the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula by the Berber dynasties of the 13th century, though it is no longer found in traditional Spanish or Portuguese cuisine. In modern day Trapani, Sicily, the dish is still made to the medieval recipe of Andalusian author Ibn Razin al-Tujibi. Ligurian families that moved from Tabarka to Sardinia brought the dish with them to Carloforte in the 18th century.Known in France since the 16th century, it was brought into French cuisine at the beginning of the 20th century via the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs.\n\nPreparation\nCouscous is traditionally made from semolina, the hardest part of the grain of durum wheat (the hardest of all forms of wheat), which resists the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished, granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny couscous granules. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of people come together to make large batches over several days, which are then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.In some regions, couscous is made from farina or coarsely ground barley or pearl millet.\n\nIn modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold worldwide. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid. Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty.\nTraditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called a taseksut in the Berber language, a \u0643\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633 kiskas in  Arabic or a couscoussier in  French language). The base is a tall metal pot shaped like an oil jar, where the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The steamer's lid has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth.\nThe couscous that is sold in most Western grocery stores is usually pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous and then leaving it covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice). Packaged sets of quick-preparation couscous and canned vegetables, and generally meat, are routinely sold in European grocery stores and supermarkets. Couscous is widely consumed in France, where it was introduced by Maghreb immigrants and voted the third most popular dish in a 2011 survey.\n\nRecognition\nIn December 2020, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia obtained official recognition for the knowledge, know-how, and practices pertaining to the production and consumption of couscous on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. The joint submission by the four countries was hailed as an \"example of international cooperation.\"\n\nLocal variations\nCouscous proper is about 2 mm in diameter, but there also exists a larger variety (3 mm more) known as berkoukes, as well as an ultra-fine version (around 1 mm). In Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, it is generally served with vegetables (carrots, potatoes, and turnips) cooked in a spicy or mild broth or stew, usually with some meat (generally, chicken, lamb, or mutton).\n\nAlgeria\nAlgerian couscous is a traditional staple food in Algeria, and it plays an important role in Algerian culture and cuisine. It is commonly served with vegetables, meat, or fish. In Algeria, there are various types of couscous dishes.\n\nTunisia\nIn Tunisia, couscous is usually spicy, made with harissa sauce, and served commonly with vegetables and meat, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef, and sometimes (in southern regions) camel. Fish couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with octopus, squid or other seafood in a hot, red, spicy sauce.\nCouscous can also be served as a dessert. It is then called Masfuf. Masfuf can also contain raisins, grapes, or pomegranate seeds.\n\nLibya\nIn Libya, couscous is mostly served with lamb (but sometimes camel meat or, rarely, beef) in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey and is locally referred to as maghrood.\n\nMalta\nIn Malta, small round pasta slightly larger than typical couscous is known as kusksu. It is commonly used in a dish of the same name, which includes broad beans (known in Maltese as ful) and \u0121bejniet, a local type of cheese.\n\nMauritania\nIn Mauritania, the couscous uses large wheat grains (mabroum) and is darker than the yellow couscous of Morocco. It is cooked with lamb, beef, or camel meat together with vegetables, primarily onion, tomato, and carrots, then mixed with a sauce and served with ghee, locally known as dhen.\n\nSimilar foods\nCouscous is made from crushed wheat flour rolled into its constituent granules or pearls, making it distinct from pasta, even pasta such as orzo and risoni of similar size, which is made from ground wheat and either molded or extruded. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined.Several dishes worldwide are also made from granules, like those of couscous rolled from flour from grains or other milled or grated starchy crops.\n\nAtti\u00e9k\u00e9, a staple food in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and surrounding regions of West Africa, is made from granulated grated cassava.\nCuscuz (Portuguese pronunciation: [kus\u02c8kus]) is a couscous-like dish from the Northeast Region of Brazil. It is made out of cornmeal and eaten hot with meat and cold with milk. In the state of S\u00e3o Paulo the cuscuz is pressed into a mold decorated with orange slices, in a dish called \"cuscuz Paulista,\" a variation of the original version made by locals after migrant waves from the Northeast Region.\nDambou is a couscous-like dish from Niger. It may be made from semolina for special occasions but is often made with rice, millet, or other grain. Moringa leaves are traditionally included in the dish. In France, this Nigerien dish has been adapted as a specific variant (called couscous aux \u00e9pinards) of the Maghreb-syle couscous commonly found there, often using spinach in place of the moringa.\nFregula is a type of pasta from Sardinia. It is similar to North African Berkoukes and Middle Eastern Moghrabieh. Fregula comes in varying sizes but typically consists of semolina dough rolled into balls 2\u20133 mm in diameter and toasted in an oven.\nKouskousaki (\u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (in Greek) or kuskus (in  Turkish) is a pasta from Greece and Turkey, that is boiled and served with cheese and walnuts.In the Levant, the dish known as moghrabieh (a reference to the Maghreb region) uses the same durum-based semolina flour but rolled into larger (5\u20136 millimetres (0.20\u20130.24 in) in diameter) 'pearls' to create a dish that is popular across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The pearls are either cooked as part of a stew or flavored with cinnamon and served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth.\nPalestinian maftoul uses granules that are larger than the North African variety but smaller than moghrabieh pearls (2\u20133 millimetres (0.079\u20130.118 in) in diameter) and made with bulgur, not durum wheat. It is similarly served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth. \"Maftoul\" is an Arabic word derived from the root \"fa-ta-la,\" which means to roll or to twist, describing the hand-rolling method used to make the granules.\nIsraeli couscous, known in Hebrew as ptitim (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, p'tit\u00edm, lit. 'flakes', singular: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea, p't\u00edt, lit. 'flake'), is made up of tiny balls of toasted pasta. It was developed in Israel in the 1950s when rice was scarce due to austerity in Israel as a higher protein alternative. Despite its name in English, it is not a type of couscous (Hebrew: \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1, kus'kus, plural: \u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05e1\u05b0\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, kuskus\u00edm).\nWusu-Wusu is a couscous that is prepared out of fonio in the Hausa region of Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana.\n\nSee also\nNorth African cuisine: Moroccan cuisine, Berber cuisine, Algerian cuisine, Tunisian cuisine, Libyan cuisine and Egyptian cuisine\nList of Middle Eastern dishes\nList of African dishes\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Candlemas, also known as the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus Christ, the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or the Feast of the Holy Encounter, is a Christian feast day commemorating the presentation of Jesus at the Temple by Joseph and Mary. It is based upon the account of the presentation of Jesus in Luke 2:22\u201340. According to the Old Testament rules in Leviticus 12, a woman was to be purified by presenting a lamb as a burnt offering, and either a young pigeon or dove as sin offering, 33 days after a boy's circumcision. The feast falls on 2 February, which is traditionally the 40th day of and the conclusion of the Christmas\u2013Epiphany season.While it is customary for Christians in some countries to remove their Christmas decorations on Twelfth Night (Epiphany Eve), those in other Christian countries historically remove them after Candlemas. On Candlemas, many Christians (especially Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and some mainline Protestant denominations including Lutherans, Anglicans and Methodists) also take their candles to their local church, where they are blessed and then used for the rest of the year; for Christians, these blessed candles serve as a symbol of Jesus Christ, who is the Light of the World.\n\nHistory\nThe Feast of the Presentation or Purification is one of the oldest feasts of the church. The pilgrim Egeria recorded how it was celebrated in Jerusalem in the 380s:\nBut certainly the Feast of the Purification is celebrated here with the greatest honour. On this day there is a procession to the Anastasis; all go in procession, and all things are done in order with great joy, just as at Easter. All the priests preach, and also the bishop, always treating of that passage of the Gospel where, on the fortieth day, Joseph and Mary brought the Lord into the Temple, and Simeon and Anna the prophetess, the daughter of Famuhel, saw Him, and of the words which they said when they saw the Lord, and of the offerings which the parents presented. And when all things have been celebrated in order as is customary, the sacrament is administered, and so the people are dismissed.\nChristmas was, in the West, celebrated on 25 December from at least the year AD 354 when it was fixed by Pope Liberius. Forty days after 25 December is 2 February. In the Eastern parts of the Roman Empire, Roman consul Justin established the celebration of the Hypapante.Pope Gelasius I (492\u2013496) contributed to the spread of the celebration but did not invent it. It appears that it became important around the time of the Plague of Justinian in 541 before slowly spreading west. The ancient Romans celebrated the Lupercalia in mid-February, in honor of Lupercus, the god of fertility and shepherds. The celebration of Feralia occurred around the same time.The Lupercalia has frequently been linked to the presentation of Jesus at the temple, particularly by Cardinal Caesar Baronius in the 16th century especially because of the theme of purification that the two festivals share. However, this is probably inaccurate since Lupercalia was not celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was only there that one finds some celebrations of the presentation of Jesus around this date. Pope Gelasius I had much earlier written a letter to senator Andromachus, who wanted to reestablish the Lupercalia for purification. The so-called Gelasian Sacramentary mentions the celebration of the Presentation of Jesus, supporting the conclusion that Gelasius substituted a Christian festival for a pagan one. However, the Gelasian Sacramentary showed a strong Gallican influence and was compiled between AD 628 and AD 731. Hence it is possible that the addition of the celebration was not due to Pope Gelasius at all.Moreover, when Gelasius addressed Andromachus, he did not try to use his authority but contented himself to argue, for example, that the Lupercalia would no longer have the effect it once had and was incompatible with Christian ideals. This could be interpreted as evidence that he had limited influence on the Roman aristocracy.Centuries later, around the year 1392 or 1400, an image of the Virgin Mary that represented this invocation was found on the seashore by two Guanche shepherds from the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands). After the appearance of the Virgin and its iconographic identification with this biblical event, the festival began to be celebrated with a Marian character in the year 1497, when the conqueror Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo celebrated the first Candlemas festival dedicated especially to the Virgin Mary, coinciding with the Feast of Purification on 2 February.  Before the conquest of Tenerife, the Guanche aborigines celebrated a festivity around the image of the Virgin during the Be\u00f1esmen festival in the month of August. This was the harvest party, which marked the beginning of the year. Currently, the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria in the Canary Islands is celebrated in addition to 2 February also on 15 August, the day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in the Catholic calendar. For some historians, the celebrations celebrated in honor of the Virgin during August are a syncretized reminiscence of the ancient feasts of the Be\u00f1esmen.The Roman church's custom of blessing candles by the clergy found its way to Germany. The German conclusion that if the sun appeared on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast a shadow, making a \"second winter\", was the origin of the modern American festival of Groundhog Day, as many of Pennsylvania's early settlers were German.\n\nCustoms\nFrance and Belgium\nCatholic churches in France, Belgium, and Swiss Romandy celebrate Candlemas (French: La Chandeleur, Dutch: Maria-Lichtmis) on 2 February. Tradition says that manger scenes should not be put away until Candlemas, which is the last feast of the Christmas cycle.Candlemas in those countries is also considered the day of cr\u00eapes. Tradition attributes this custom to Pope Gelasius I, who had pancakes distributed to pilgrims arriving in Rome. Their round shape and golden color, reminiscent of the solar disc, refer to the return of spring after the dark and cold of winter. Even today, a specific symbolism can be associated with preparing the cr\u00eapes. A tradition is to flip the crepes in the air with the right hand while holding a gold coin (such as a Louis d'or) or some other coin in the left hand to have prosperity throughout the year. One has to ensure that the pancake lands properly back in the pan.In Belgium, it is customary to eat pancakes. All the candles in the house should be lit. It is believed that a clear sky on Candlemas foretells a beneficial year for beekeepers.\n\nGermany\nCandlemas used to be an important date (Lostag) in the year. It was associated with payment deadlines, fixed employment relationships, and the beginning of the \"farmer's year\". In addition, many customs, weather proverbs, other sayings, and rhymes are related to this feast.\nThe \"farmer's year\" began on Candlemas, and from then on, fieldwork or the preparations for it can be resumed depending on the circumstances. On Candlemas, the farmer should have had half of the winter food stock for his cattle. Depending on the proverb that one can eat by daylight on Candlemas, the time in which people worked with artificial light sources came to an end, as did when the women sat in the spinning room.\nOn this day, on the other hand, the \"servant's year\" ended. The servants were paid the remainder of their annual wages and could or had to look for a new job or extend their employment with the previous employer for another year, usually with a handshake. The custom of giving the servants a pair of shoes at Candlemas as a reward for further work or looking for a job was also widespread.\n\nLuxembourg\nA descendant of an ancient torchlight procession, the current tradition of Liichtm\u00ebssdag in Luxembourg is a holiday centered around children. In small groups, they roam the streets in the afternoon or evening of 2 February, holding a lighted lantern or homemade wand, singing traditional songs at each house or store, especially \"L\u00e9iwer H\u00e4rgottsblieschen\". In exchange for the music, they hope to receive a reward in the form of sweets or loose change (formerly bacon, peas, or biscuits).\n\nCanary Islands\nLa Virgen de la Candelaria or Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria (Our Lady of Light or Our Lady of Candles), popularly called La Morenita, celebrates the Virgin Mary on the island of Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands (Spain). Our Lady of Light is the patron saint of the Canary Islands. The Basilica of Candelaria in Candelaria, Tenerife is considered to be the main church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and has been a minor basilica since 2009. Her feast is celebrated on 2 February (Candlemas, Fiesta de la Candelaria) and 15 August as the patronal feast of the Canary Islands.\n\nSweden and Finland\nIn Swedish and Finnish Lutheran churches, since 1774 Candlemas has been celebrated on the Sunday between 2 and 8 February inclusive. If this Sunday happens to be the last Sunday before Lent, i.e. Shrove Sunday or Quinquagesima (Swedish: Fastlagss\u00f6ndagen, Finnish: Laskiaissunnuntai), Candlemas is celebrated one week earlier.\n\nThe Philippines\nIn the Philippines, Our Lady of Candles is also the patroness of Western Visayas region.  In Silang, Cavite, her feast is observed locally as a triduum from 1 to 3 February, with 2 February as the actual feast day.\n\nPuerto Rico\nThis festivity officially finalizes the end of Christmas for Catholics in Puerto Rico; the festivities include a procession where the statue of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Candelaria (Our Lady of the Light) is carried on the shoulders. Others follow with lit candles until they reach the church where a Mass is celebrated. In the evening, the festivities may continue with a giant bonfire and singing. Some families in the countryside burn their dried Christmas trees on this date as a culmination of the holiday season.\n\nGuatemala\nThe Virgin of Candles is the patron saint of Jacaltenango, and her feast marks the end of the Christmas season.\n\nMexico\nDressing and adoration of the Christ Child and family meals with tamales on Candlemas are an important Mexican tradition. The customs of this feast is closely linked to that of the Epiphany, during which the tasting of the rosca de reyes (kings cake) will determine who is responsible for organizing La candelaria. Whoever finds the mu\u00f1eco (bean-shaped Christ Child]) in the cake is named godparent of the Christ child, who will then dress the ni\u00f1o dios (an image of the Christ child in the form of a doll) on Candlemas with richly decorated clothes. This Christ child is then brought to the church to be blessed. Memories of these events are often passed down from generation to generation in families.Following this is the family meal. Whoever draws the bean on Epiphany must also prepare tamales, believed to echo Mexico's pre-Christian past with its offerings of maize. The whole family is invited to this meal (often the same people as for the Rosca at Epiphany), which gives the festival an aspect of family and sharing.\n\nPeru\nThe Virgin of Candles is the patron saint of the city of Puno in Peru, held in the first fortnight of February each year. It is one of the largest festivals of culture, music, and dancing in Peru. In terms of the number of events related to the cultures of the Quechua and Aymara peoples and of the mestizos of the Altiplano, and also in terms of the number of people directly and indirectly involved in its realization, it stands with the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro and the Carnaval de Oruro in Bolivia as one of the three largest festivals in South America.\nAt the festival's core are music and dance performances organized by the Federaci\u00f3n Regional de Folklore y Cultura de Puno, consisting of more than 200 dances in more than 150 dance sets. These include \"native dances\" from the various communities in Puno and sets of dances organized in different quarters of the city, mostly those known as \"costume dances\". These performances directly involve 40,000 dancers and some 5,000 musicians and indirectly involve about 25,000 people, including directors, sponsors, embroiderers, and the makers of masks, clothing, boots, shoes, bells, and other items, as well as the bandsmen and staff. Some dance groups are linked to uniformed organizations.\n\nSee also\nChristianity portal\nLiturgical year\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nMergnac, Marie-Odile; K\u00f6hler, Thomas (2008).

Traditionally made on bakestones or griddles, the crempog is one of the oldest recipes in Wales. They are also known as ffroes, pancos and cramoth and are normally served thickly piled into a stack and spread with butter. It is traditionally served at celebrations in Wales, such as Shrove Tuesday and birthdays.\n\nName\nThe word \"crempog\" has its origins in the Welsh language, but is similar to the Breton word krampouezh, which is also a type of pancake. Comparisons are often drawn between the two Celtic languages which share ancestry in the Brittonic language, though the krampouezh is more dainty than the crempog and is today closer to a cr\u00eape than a pancake.The English word crumpet may be derived from crempog or Cornish krampoeth.\n\nHistory\nThe history of food in Wales is poorly documented, and much of what is known lies in verbal and archaeological evidence. Wales has a long history of baking using a bakestone (Welsh: maen), a large round portable flatstone. The flagstone was replaced by a metal plate known as a gradell (griddle), and these appeared among the list of objects made by blacksmiths in the Laws of Hywel Dda (13th century). Bakestones were commonly used throughout rural Wales for making flatbreads with evidence of their use found in farmhouses and in the homes of landed gentry. Early flat stones were placed on a tripod over an open fire, though in many areas, especially in south-west Wales, a specially designed circular iron frame with a half hoop handle was used. By the early decades of the twentieth century built-in wall ovens were common throughout kitchens in Wales, though these would be wood and coal burning. The tradition of using a bakestone coexisted with these newer ovens. Heating the large ovens was generally confined to one day a week and was used to make bread and cakes to last the family until the next week. These were augmented with whatever could be cooked over the open fireplace using the bakestone. Common foods cooked using this method were cacen radell (griddle cake), bara crai' (unleavened bread), cacen gri (speckled cakes) and crempog.Although there is no documented evidence of the earliest crempog recipe, the basic ingredients, readily available in Wales suggests a long history. The recipe for crempog reflects very old cookery traditions that were once common throughout Britain. Bobby Freeman, writing in 1980, states that crempog, along with cawl, is the one Welsh ingredient to have endured from past times. Despite crempog being a staple of Welsh cuisine due to its ease of preparation in past times, it is also connected to traditional celebrations. Crempog was served on Shrove Tuesday throughout Wales and was associated with birthdays, especially in south Wales, where the stack of pancakes are cut down in wedges and served like a cake.\n\nPreparation\nFor the standard crempog recipe, butter is melted in warm buttermilk and then poured into a well of flour and beaten. The mixture is meant to stand for a few hours. A second mixture is made using sugar, bicarbonate of soda, vinegar and beaten eggs. The mixtures are then combined to make a smooth, dense batter.The thick batter is poured onto a hot bakestone or griddle, over a moderate heat. The crempog is cooked until golden on both sides and served in a stack with butter spread on each pancake.\n\nVariants\nIn Anglesey and Caernarfonshire crempogau were prepared as crempog furum, a pancake made with yeast, or crempug wen where the normally coarse flour was replaced with refined flour. These pancakes were meant for the family of the house with the servants of the house being served crempog surgeirch or bara bwff, an oatmeal-based pancake.Although crempog is the term most commonly associated with Welsh pancakes they were known by different names around the country. Crempog was the term most often used in north Wales, while in parts of Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan they were known as cramwythen (singular: cramoth). In other parts of Glamorgan they were known as ffrosen (plural: ffroes), while in Cardiganshire they were called poncagen (plural: poncagau). In some areas of both Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire they were known as pancosen.As with most meals there are no specific recipe for crempog. The Glamorganshire ffroes are almost identical to Scottish pancakes (drop scones), which may have been brought to the region by Scottish labourers during the industrialization of the south Wales coalfields, but the piling of them into a stack smothered in butter harks to Welsh traditions.\n\nIn poetry\nA Welsh verse sung by children refers to crempogau:\n\nModryb Elin Enog\nOs gwelwch chi'n dda ga i grempog?\nCew chithau de a siwgr brown\nA phwdin lond eich ffedog\nModryb Elin Enog\nMae 'ngheg i'n grimp am grempog\nMae Mam rhy dlawd i brynu blawd\nA Sian yn  rhy ddiog i nol y triog\nA 'nhad yn rhy wael i weithio\nOs gwelwch chi'n dda ga i grempogIn English:\n\nAuntie Elin Enog\nPlease may I have a pancake?\nYou can have tea and brown sugar\nAnd your apron full of pudding\nAuntie Elin Enog\nMy mouth is parched for pancakes\nMy mum is too poor to buy flour\nAnd Sian is too lazy to get the treacle\nAnd my father's too sick to work\nPlease may I have a pancake?\n\nSee also\nCrumpet\nList of pancakes\nList of English words of Celtic origin\n food portal\n\nReferences\nBibliographyDavies, John; Jenkins, Nigel; Menna, Baines; Lynch, Peredur I., eds.

It should not be mistaken for a regular pan or a cr\u00eape pan.\n\nOrigins\nCr\u00eape makers were originally large cast-iron plates set over the fire to cook cereal-based batters. The machines have since evolved and the cast-iron plates were set on top of stainless steel frames. These first machines were electric machines, and later on, gas cr\u00eape griddles were developed as well. Although professional cast-iron cr\u00eape makers usually need to be seasoned, non-stick cast-iron griddles can now be commonly found on the market.\n\nDenomination\nCr\u00eape cooking machines are commonly referred to as cr\u00eape makers or cr\u00eape griddles.\nThey are also known as billig, mainly in Brittany, France, where cr\u00eapes originated.

Chongqing hot pot is similar to the dry stir-fried mala xiang guo (\u9ebb\u8fa3\u9999\u9505) which is also eaten in restaurants.The traditional way of preparing and eating this style of dish is to put the food in a hot pot, wait for the food to cook, and when the food is ready, dip the pieces in sesame oil and eat them. People choose various kinds of food to prepare in Chongqing hot pot, such as beef, pork, chicken, Chinese sausages, beef strips, pig blood, and duck intestine.\n\nGeneral recipes\nAs one of the most spicy types of hot pot, Chongqing hot pot uses different ingredients when making the hot pot base. The spicy Chongqing hot pot base is mainly red chili oil, which is made with beef fat and different kinds of spices, such as bay leaf, clove, cinnamon and so on. Chili, beef tallow, garlic, bean paste and other seasonings are stir-fried and boiled for a long time to form Chongqing hotpot seasoning, which is used in Chongqing hotpot soup base.\n\nHistory\nThe history of Chongqing hot pot started in the 1920s in Jiangbei District in Chongqing. In the beginning, the peddlers who worked on the wharf at the time would buy beef tripe, clean and boil it, and then cut beef liver and stomach into small pieces, and place it all into a clay stove. The stove used an iron basin to divide the stove into different sections that separated ingredients with different taste. When the spicy and salty soup boiled, the laborers would begin to eat, each person choosing their own food and own area divided in the stove, so they only eat and pay for what they put in that division, which is cheaper. It was not until the 23rd year of the Republic of China that a small restaurant in Chongqing turned the hot pot into a high-grade dish; before that, there was no restaurant that served Chongqing hot pot.Liuyishou Hotpot has opened 1,200 restaurants worldwide.\n\nCulture\nChongqing hot pot is not only a local delicacy, but also represents Chongqing's food culture. When eating the hot pot, families and friends gather together and surround the steaming hot pot, talking with each other. It is a suitable food choice for the traditional Chinese culture of reunion. In Chongqing, there were a total of 26,991 hot pot restaurants in 2019.\n\nSee also\nChongqing noodles\nHot pot\nMalatang\nMala xiang guo\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Linby is a small village and civil parish in Nottinghamshire, England. The nearest town is Hucknall which is immediately to the south-west. The village grew up around the mills on the River Leen, from which Linby's name is derived. Small streams known as Linby Docks run on both sides of the main street. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 232, increasing to 676 at the 2021 census.\n\nHistory\nIn the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870\u201372) John Marius Wilson described Linby:\n\nLINBY, or LINDEBY, a village and a parish in Basford district, Notts. The village stands adjacent to the Nottingham and Mansfield railway, near the river Leen, 9\u00bc miles N by W of Nottingham; has a station on the railway, and a post office under Nottingham; and has Likewise two ancient crosses, which were supposed to mark an entrance-boundary of Sherwood forest.\u2014The parish comprises 1,190 acres. Real property, \u00a32,147; of which \u00a325 are in quarries. Pop. in 1851, 310; in 1861, 257. Houses, 53. The property is not divided. The manor belongs to A. F. W. Montagu, Esq. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Lincoln. Value, \u00a3280. I Patron, A. F. W. Montagu, Esq. The church was re.cently restored, has a tower, and contains monuments of the Chaworths.\nThe local parish church is dedicated to St. Michael and is a Grade II* listed building. Containing a number of features which date to the 13th century, the church has been extended several times, including restorations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.There are two crosses in the village. The \"Top Cross\", a Grade II listed structure, is dated to the 14th century and was restored in the late 19th century. The \"Bottom Cross\" is inscribed with the date 1663, and may have been dedicated to the restoration of King Charles II.Linby won Nottinghamshire's \"best kept village\" award in 2013.\n\nAdministration\nFrom 1894 to 1974 the village was part of Basford Rural District. It was then transferred to Gedling Borough. However, a small part of the parish had been transferred to Hucknall Urban District Council in 1935. Linby is included in the Hidden Valleys area of Nottinghamshire.\n\nTransport\nThe Linby Trail is a 2 km stretch of the National Cycle Route starting at the village and finishing at nearby Newstead Village.\nThree railway lines once passed through Linby, with stations on two of them. The first was the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS) line from Nottingham to Mansfield and Worksop, closed to passengers on 12 October 1964 though partly retained as a freight route serving collieries at Annesley. In the 1990s this line was reopened to passengers in stages, the section through Linby in 1993, but Linby station did not reopen with it.The second line was the Great Northern Railway (later part of the LNER) route serving many of the same places as the Midland. It closed to passengers on 14 September 1931 but remained in use for freight until 25 March 1968. The Linby station on this line had closed long before, on 1 July 1916.The third line was the Great Central Railway (also later part of the LNER), the last main line ever built from the north of England to London, opened on 15 March 1899. The stretch through Linby (which crossed over both the other lines), closed completely on 5 September 1966, but there had never been a Linby station on this line.\n\nSports\nThe village has a football team, Linby Colliery F.C.\n\nSee also\nListed buildings in Linby\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLinby Village website",

        "body": "Mbeju is a starch cake sometimes made with fari\u00f1a or manioc flour typical of Paraguay. The recipe has existed since the 18th century and its origins lie with the indigenous Cario-Guarani people that lived in the Asunci\u00f3n and its surroundings.\nThe name \"mbej\u00fa\" (also written \"mbey\u00fa\") means \"cake\" and comes from the Guarani language. Guarani is one of the two official languages of Paraguay, which defines itself as being bilingual and multi-cultural. The mbej\u00fa is bound to the Guarani mythology to be one of the most ancient recipes of this culture. Traditionally, there were about 16 ways to prepare it, although nowadays, 11 are recognized. Next to the chipa and the sopa paraguaya it is part of the so-called \"tyra\", a Guarani term for food consumed to accompany the \"mate cocido\", milk or coffee, or simply an addition to other dishes.\n\nHistory\nSome revisionist historians point out that, during the colonial era, the German traveler Ulrich Schmidl was already talking about the recipe for that kind of starchy bread made by the Cario-Guarani people (a native tribe who used to live in Asunci\u00f3n). Schmidl was in charge of noting in the logbook of the Spanish ship in which the expedition led by Juan de Ayolas arrived, which would arrive in Asunci\u00f3n later, thus giving rise to the first encounter between Spaniards and the Cario-Guarani people. Before being known as mbeju, there was a menu that was already part of the varieties of bread that the Cario-Guarani natives had in the early days of the conquest. Back then, the food the Cario-Guarani people used to eat was \u201cmbujape\u201d, which translated from Guarani means \u201cbread\u201d. To cook the mbujap\u00e9, corn flour or cassava starch was combined with animal fat and then it was wrapped in a banana leaf and placed in the tanimb\u00fa to cook it.There is the wrong idea of naming Paraguayan cuisine as \"Guarani cuisine\". Paraguayan gastronomy was born from the fusion of Spanish cuisine and Cario-Guaran\u00ed cuisine, which was developed due to the influence of the Franciscan priests, the Spanish conquers and the mestizos asuncenos, which took place in Asunci\u00f3n and its surroundings. Towns such as Tobat\u00ed, Atyr\u00e1, Altos, Aregu\u00e1, Ypan\u00e9, Guarambar\u00e9, It\u00e1 and Yaguar\u00f3n are living examples of how Paraguayan culture developed outside and far from the mercantile influence of the Jesuits. When the Jesuits were expelled in 1767, the natives returned to their natural habitat (the Atlantic jungle) and they never go to Asunci\u00f3n and its area of influence to educate or teach, proof of this is the extinction of Jesuit ceramics and not the Franciscan that is still alive in It\u00e1, Aregu\u00e1 and Tobat\u00ed.The root cuisine of the Cario-Guarani consisted of hunting, fishing, grain crops, cooking techniques and methods, as well as the utensils they made. The first antecedents of Spanish and Cario-Guaran\u00ed syncretism took place at the time of the foundation of Asunci\u00f3n and surroundings, where the Franciscan reductions of Altos, Atyr\u00e1, Guarambar\u00e9, It\u00e1, etc. were later founded. In the Governorate of Paraguay, a Catholic jurisdiction called \"Paraguaria Province\" was circumscribed. This province, dependent on the Viceroyalty of Peru, covered the regions of Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay, and parts of Bolivia, Brazil and Chile (between 1604 and 1617). Since 1617, the Paraguaria Province was dismembered to the Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata and the Governorate of Paraguay, thus remaining under the jurisdiction of the latter. Then this region became part of the ephemeral Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata (1776-1810). The culture developed in Greater Paraguay was very strong since the Guarani people were used by the conquerors and evangelizers as intermediaries with other Amerindian civilizations. For these reasons, the Paraguayan culture that characterizes Asunci\u00f3n remained strong in this area, and in turn spread to areas where the cattle were later introduced, with the founding of Corrientes in 1588, the oldest city in the northeast of Argentina.\nIn the logs (of travelers such as Ulrich Schmidl) and in the historical records of the colonial era, it appears in several paragraphs that the Cario-Guarani (a tribe that inhabited the Asunci\u00f3n area) prepared cakes and breads based on cassava, corn, and sweet corn mixed with animal fat, known as \"mbujap\u00e9\" (\"bread\" in Guarani language). The Cario-Guarani diet was complemented with European foods that the Spaniards brought from the old continent. This was due to the introduction of cattle in 1556 in Asunci\u00f3n, so thanks to these animals the new ingredients were finally obtained such as beef, milk, eggs, cheese, etc. In this way, the meals derived from the Cario-Guarani gastronomic base (corn, cassava, pumpkin, sweet potato, etc.) were finally mixed with the ingredients brought by the Spaniards (meat, milk, cheese, eggs, etc.). This union gave rise to foods that have been consumed from the colonial era to the present. In this context, the recipe for typical Paraguayan dishes actually originated, which has cassava, corn, sweet corn, Paraguay cheese, milk and beef as their base ingredients.\n\nIngredients\nTraditional mbej\u00fa require starch, corn flour, pork fat, thin salt, fresh cheese and milk. The variety called \"mbej\u00fa avevo\" (\"inflated cake\") uses the same ingredients but with the pork fat, the eggs and the cheese in larger quantities. Another variant, \"mbej\u00fa de fari\u00f1a\" in which manioc flour is used instead of manioc starch.\nThere are other recipes for the Mbeju. Mbeju cuatro quesos, for example, which means mbeju with extra cheese, requires 250 grams of cassava starch, 75 grams of butter, 150 grams of fresh cheese, 2 spoonful of milk, salt, 2 tomatoes perita, 100 grams of cuartirolo cheese, 50 grams catupyry cheese, oregano, basil leaves, and black pepper.\n\nPreparation\nThe starch is sifted. Fat and the crumbled cheese are added and the mixture is whipped until creamy. Eggs, salt and milk are added as the whipping continues. Finally the starch and corn flour are added, mixing everything using the hands until a thick powder-like preparation results.\nA greased frying pan is allowed to get very hot. A layer of the mixture of about 1\u00bd centimeters is put into the pan, squeezing the borders with the back of a spoon. It is cooked for a few minutes, moving the pan so it cooks evenly without burning the center. Using the lid of the pan, flip the mbej\u00fa, finishing the cooking the same way as above.\nSteps for the extra cheese mbeju: \nPut the Paraguayan cheese into a bowl with the butter and whisk with a spoon until it is creamed. Add the starch and a little bit of salt, as soon as it gets hard add some milk and whisk again until it gets creamy.\nFor the filling, cut the tomatoes and the cheese into slices. In a hot pan add the dough covering the entire surface, on the top add the tomatoes and the cheese the oregano, basil, and a little bit of pepper. \nCover up the pan again with some more dough, and cook for 3 minutes on each side.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAsunci\u00f3n 1537: Madre de la gastronom\u00eda del R\u00edo de la Plata y de Matto Grosso do Sul.

        "body": "Shrove Tuesday (also known as Pancake Tuesday or Pancake Day) is the final day of Shrovetide, marking the end of pre-Lent. Lent begins the following day with Ash Wednesday. Shrove Tuesday is observed in many Christian countries through participating in confession; the ritual burning of the previous year's Holy Week palms; finalizing one's Lenten sacrifice; as well as eating pancakes and other sweets.Shrove Tuesday is observed by many Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, who \"make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\" This moveable feast is determined by the date of Easter. The expression \"Shrove Tuesday\" comes from the word shrive, meaning absolution following confession. Christians traditionally visit their church on Shrove Tuesday to confess their sins and clean their soul, thus being shriven (absolved) before the start of Lent.As this is the last day of the Christian liturgical season historically known as Carnival or Shrovetide, before the penitential season of Lent, related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one might give up as their Lenten sacrifice for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations. The term Mardi Gras is French for \"Fat Tuesday\", referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season, which begins on Ash Wednesday. Many Christian congregations thus observe the day through eating pancakes or, more specifically, the holding of pancake breakfasts, as well as the ringing of church bells to remind people to repent of their sins before the start of Lent. On Shrove Tuesday, churches also burn the palms distributed during the previous year's Palm Sunday liturgies to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.In some Christian countries, especially those where the day is called Mardi Gras or a translation thereof, it is a carnival day, the last day of \"fat eating\" or \"gorging\" before the fasting period of Lent.\n\nHistory\nThe tradition of marking the start of Lent has been documented for centuries. \u00c6lfric of Eynsham's \"Ecclesiastical Institutes\" from around 1000 AD states: \"In the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do [in the way of penance]\". By the time of the late Middle Ages, the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent.During the liturgical season of Lent, believers have historically abstained from rich foods such as meat, eggs, lacticinia (dairy products), and alcohol\u2014a practice that continues in Eastern Christianity (in denominations such as the Coptic Orthodox Church) and among Western Christian congregations practicing the Daniel Fast. Shrovetide provided Christians with the opportunity to use up these foods prior to the start of the 40-day fasting season of Lent. Prior to the 6th century, Lent was normatively observed through the practice of the Black Fast, which enjoins fasting from food and liquids, with the allowance of one vegetarian meal after sunset. The tradition of pancake breakfasts during Shrovetide, as well as that of pancake races, owes itself to this practice of \"using up the surplus eggs, milk and butter\" prior to Lent. As such, it was traditional in many societies to eat pancakes or other foods made with the butter, eggs and fat or lard that would need to be used up before the beginning of Lent. Similar foods are fasnachts and p\u0105czki. The specific custom of British Christians eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday dates to the 16th century.Along with its emphasis on feasting, another theme of Shrove Tuesday involves Christians repenting of their sins in preparation to begin the season of Lent in the Christian liturgical calendar. In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) \"to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent\" and for people to \"begin frying their pancakes\".\n\nTerminology\nThe word shrove is a form of the English word shrive, which means to give absolution for someone's sins by way of Confession and doing penance. Thus Shrove Tuesday was named after the custom of Christians to be \"shriven\" before the start of Lent.In the United Kingdom, Ireland and parts of the Commonwealth, Shrove Tuesday is also known as Pancake Day or Pancake Tuesday, as it became a traditional custom to eat pancakes as a meal. In Irish the day is known as M\u00e1irt Inide, from the Latin initium (Jej\u016bni\u012b), \"beginning of Lent.\"  Elsewhere, the day has also been called \"Mardi Gras\", meaning \"Fat Tuesday\", after the type of celebratory meal that day.In Germany, the day is known as Fastnachtsdienstag, Faschingsdienstag, Karnevalsdienstag or Veilchendienstag (the last of which translates to violet [the flower] Tuesday). It is celebrated with fancy dress and a partial school holiday. Similarly, in German American areas, such as Pennsylvania Dutch Country, it is known as Fastnacht Day.In the Netherlands, it is known as \"vastenavond\", or in Limburgish dialect \"vastelaovend\", though the word \"vastelaovend\" usually refers to the entire period of carnival in the Netherlands. In some parts of Switzerland (e.g. Lucerne), the day is called G\u00fcdeldienstag or G\u00fcdisdienstag (preceded by G\u00fcdismontag). According to the Duden dictionary, the term derives from \"G\u00fcdel\", which means a fat belly stuffed full of food.In Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, among others, it is known as Carnival (to use the English spelling). This derives from Medieval Latin carnelevamen (\"the putting away of flesh\") and thus to another aspect of the Lenten fast, to abstain from eating meat. It is often celebrated with street processions or fancy dress.The most famous of these events has become the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Venetians have long celebrated carnival with a masquerade. The use of the term \"carnival\" in other contexts derives from this celebration. In Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named \"d\u00eda de la tortilla\" (\"omelette day\"): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten. On the Portuguese island of Madeira, malasadas are eaten on Ter\u00e7a-feira Gorda (Fat Tuesday in English), which is also the last day of the Carnival of Madeira. Malasadas were cooked in order to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lenten restrictions. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugar plantations of the 1800s. The resident Catholic Portuguese workers (who came mostly from Madeira and the Azores) used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of malasadas.In the Lutheran countries of Denmark and Norway, the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday is called Fetetirsdag (\"Fat Tuesday\"); the prior weekend is known as Fastelavn and is marked by eating fastelavnsboller. Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark, held either on the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to be a time for children's fun and family games and on Shrove Sunday, \"the churches hold a special family service where children are invited to wear fancy dress.\" In Estonia, the day is similarly called Vastlap\u00e4ev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam-filled sweet-buns called vastlakukkel, similar to the Swedish fastlagsbulle or semla. Children also typically go sledding on this day.In Iceland, the day is known as Sprengidagur (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, the day is called U\u017egav\u0117n\u0117s. People eat pancakes (blynai) and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday), and is generally celebrated by eating a type of sweet roll called fastlagsbulle or semla. In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging.\nIn Poland, a related celebration falls on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday and is called t\u0142usty czwartek (Fat Thursday). In some areas of the United States with large Polish-American communities, such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Buffalo, T\u0142usty Czwartek is celebrated with p\u0105czki or faworki eating contests, music and other Polish food. It may be held on Shrove Tuesday or in the days immediately preceding it.In Slovenia, Kurentovanje is also the biggest and best known carnival. There are several more local carnivals usually referred to as Laufarija. In Hungary, and the Hungarian-speaking territories, it is called H\u00fashagy\u00f3kedd (lit.\u2009'the Tuesday leaving the meat') and is celebrated by fancy dress and visiting neighbours.\n\nTraditions\nShrove Tuesday serves a dual purpose of allowing Christians to repent of any sins they might have committed before the start of Lent on the next day Ash Wednesday and giving them the opportunity to engage in a last round of merriment before the start of the somber Lenten season, which is characterized by making a Lenten sacrifice, fasting, praying and engaging in various spiritual disciplines, such as marking a Lenten calendar, fasting, abstaining from luxuries, and reading a daily devotional.The Lenten fast traditionally emphasizes eating simpler, vegetarian food, and refraining from food that would give undue pleasure; as such, Christians historically abstained from meat, eggs and lacticinia (dairy products) during the 40-day fasting season of Lent\u2014a practice that continues in Eastern Christianity (in denominations such as the Coptic Orthodox Church) and among Western Christian congregations practicing the Daniel Fast. Pancakes are associated with Shrove Tuesday, the day preceding Lent, because they are a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent.In Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island, small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes. Children take delight in discovering the objects, which are intended to be divinatory. For example, the person who receives a coin will be wealthy; a nail indicates that they will become or marry a carpenter.\n\nObservances\nOn the final day of Shrovetide, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, \"make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\" As such, many churches offer Confession on Shrove Tuesday.On Shrove Tuesday, many Christians finalize their decision with respect to what Lenten sacrifices they will make for Lent. While making a Lenten sacrifice, it is customary to pray for strength to keep it; many often wish others for doing so as well, e.g. \"May God bless your Lenten sacrifice.\"During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year's Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies; on Shrove Tuesday, churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.\n\nFestivities\nIn the United Kingdom, as part of community celebration, many towns held traditional Shrove Tuesday \"mob football\" games, some dating as far back as the 17th century. The practice mostly died out in the 19th century after the passing of the Highway Act 1835 which banned playing football on public highways. A number of towns have maintained the tradition, including Alnwick in Northumberland (Scoring the Hales), Ashbourne in Derbyshire (called the Royal Shrovetide Football), Atherstone in Warwickshire (called simply the Atherstone Ball Game), St Columb Major in Cornwall (called Hurling the Silver Ball), and Sedgefield in County Durham (Sedgefield Ball Game).Shrove Tuesday was once known as a \"half-holiday\" in Britain. It started at 11:00 am with the ringing of a church bell. On Pancake Day, \"pancake races\" are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The tradition is said to have originated in 1445 when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her frying pan and pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning. The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England. Participants with frying pans race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan while running. The pancake race at Olney traditionally has women contestants who carry a frying pan and race over a 415-yard (379 m) course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants must toss the pancake at the start and the finish, and wear a scarf and apron.Since 1950, the people of Liberal, Kansas, and Olney have held the \"International Pancake Day\" race between the two towns. The two towns' competitors race along an agreed-upon measured course. The times of the two towns' competitors are compared to determine a winner overall. As of 2021, Liberal leads the competition with 38 wins to Olney's 31. A similar race is held in North Somercotes in Lincolnshire, England.In London, the Rehab Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of Rehab, which provides a range of health and social care, training, education, and employment services in the UK for disabled people and others who are marginalised.\nScarborough celebrates by closing the foreshore to all traffic, closing schools early, and inviting all to skip. Traditionally, long ropes were used from the nearby harbour. The town crier rang the pancake bell, situated on the corner of Westborough (main street) and Huntriss Row. Since 1996 a replica \"pancake bell\" situated at Newborough and North Street has been rung to initiate the day's festivities.Shrove Tuesday in England often involved a form of ritual begging, not dissimilar to wassailing, in which children and adolescents would go door-to-door asking for tidbits from the frying pan. If the household was not forthcoming, they could expect levels of mischief, including the pelting of their house, knock and run, or gate stealing. This was known as Lent Crocking, Nicky-Nan Night, the Drawing of Cloam, Dappy-Door Night, or Pan Sharding. The children of the hamlet of Whitechapel, Lancashire, keep alive a local variant of this tradition by visiting local households and asking \"please a pancake\", to be rewarded with oranges or sweets. It is thought this local tradition arose when farm workers visited the wealthier farm and manor owners to ask for pancakes or pancake fillings.In Ireland, the observance of fasting at Lent continued up to the 20th century, with Shrove Tuesday (Irish: M\u00e1irt na hInide, \"Tuesday of the initium\") marking the last day of the consumption of meat for the Lenten period. This was later relaxed, but with three days of fasting observed, Ash Wednesday, Spy Wednesday, and Good Friday. It was a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter would toss the first pancake. If the pancake fell on the floor, she would remain unmarried for the next 12 months. As marriages were not traditionally permitted during the Lenten period, as decreed by the Council of Trent, weddings on Shrove Tuesday were popular. In some parts of Ireland the holly from Christmas was saved and burnt in the fire for the pancakes. The night was also known as \"Skellig Night\" in Counties Cork and Kerry, during the celebrations, those who were unmarried were taunted with jeers and singing.In Fennoscandia, in particular in Finland and Sweden, as well as Estonia, the day is associated with the semla, a type of almond paste-filled sweet roll.The day is known as Laskiainen in Finland and Vastlap\u00e4ev in Estonia. It is a celebration of Balto-Finnic origins, which includes both pagan and ecclesiastic traditions, and is often described as a \"mid-winter sliding festival\".Thin pancakes called blini are traditional in Christian festivals in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia also at this time of year (Maslenitsa).\n\nDates\nShrove Tuesday is exactly 47 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The date can be between 3 February and 9 March inclusive.\nShrove Tuesday occurs on these dates:\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorldwide Pancake Recipes: Archived 11 March 2014 at the Wayback Machine A collection of recipes from different countries",

        "body": "Pancake sorting is the mathematical problem of sorting a disordered stack of pancakes in order of size when a spatula can be inserted at any point in the stack and used to flip all pancakes above it.  A pancake number is the minimum number of flips required for a given number of pancakes. In this form, the problem was first discussed by American geometer Jacob E. Goodman. A variant of the problem is concerned with burnt pancakes, where each pancake has a burnt side and all pancakes must, in addition, end up with the burnt side on bottom.\nAll sorting methods require pairs of elements to be compared. For the traditional sorting problem, the usual problem studied is to minimize the number of comparisons required to sort a list. The number of actual operations, such as swapping two elements, is then irrelevant. For pancake sorting problems, in contrast, the aim is to minimize the number of operations, where the only allowed operations are reversals of the elements of some prefix of the sequence. Now, the number of comparisons is irrelevant.\n\nThe pancake problems\nThe original pancake problem\nThe minimum number of flips required to sort any stack of n pancakes has been shown to lie between 15/14n and 18/11n (approximately 1.07n and 1.64n), but the exact value is not known.The simplest pancake sorting algorithm performs at most 2n \u2212 3 flips. In this algorithm, a kind of selection sort, we bring the largest pancake not yet sorted to the top with one flip; take it down to its final position with one more flip; and repeat this process for the remaining pancakes.\nIn 1979, Bill Gates and Christos Papadimitriou gave a lower bound of 17/16n (approximately 1.06n) flips and an upper bound of (5n+5)/3. The upper bound was improved, thirty years later, to  18/11n by a team of researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas, led by Founders Professor Hal Sudborough.In 2011, Laurent Bulteau, Guillaume Fertin, and Irena Rusu proved that the problem of finding the shortest sequence of flips for a given stack of pancakes is NP-hard, thereby answering a question that had been open for over three decades.\n\nThe burnt pancake problem\nIn a variation called the burnt pancake problem, the bottom of each pancake in the pile is burnt, and the sort must be completed with the burnt side of every pancake down. It is a signed permutation, and if a pancake i is \"burnt side up\" a negative element i` is put in place of i in the permutation. In 2008, a group of undergraduates built a bacterial computer that can solve a simple example of the burnt pancake problem by programming E. coli to flip segments of DNA which are analogous to burnt pancakes. DNA has an orientation (5' and 3') and an order (promoter before coding). Even though the processing power expressed by DNA flips is low, the high number of bacteria in a culture provides a large parallel computing platform. The bacteria report when they have solved the problem by becoming antibiotic resistant.\n\nThe identical pancakes stack problem\nThis is inspired from the way Indian bread (roti or chapati) is cooked. Initially, all rotis are stacked in one column, and the cook uses a spatula to flip the rotis so that each side of each roti touches the base fire at some point to toast. Several variants are possible: the rotis can be considered as single-sided or two-sided, and it may be forbidden or not to toast the same side twice. This version of the problem was first explored by Arka Roychowdhury.\n\nThe pancake problem on strings\nThe discussion above presumes that each pancake is unique, that is, the sequence on which the prefix reversals are performed is a permutation. However, \"strings\" are sequences in which a symbol can repeat, and this repetition may reduce the number of prefix reversals required to sort. Chitturi and Sudborough (2010) and Hurkens et al. (2007) independently showed that the complexity of transforming a compatible string into another with the minimum number of prefix reversals is NP-complete. They also gave bounds for the same. Hurkens et al. gave an exact algorithm to sort binary and ternary strings. Chitturi  (2011) proved that the complexity of transforming a compatible signed string into another with the minimum number of signed prefix reversals\u2014the burnt pancake problem on strings\u2014is NP-complete.\n\nHistory\nThe pancake sorting problem was first posed by Jacob E. Goodman, writing under the pseudonym \"Harry Dweighter\" (\"harried waiter\").Although seen more often as an educational device, pancake sorting also appears in applications in parallel processor networks, in which it can provide an effective routing algorithm between processors.The problem is notable as the topic of the only well-known mathematics paper by Microsoft founder Bill Gates (as William Gates), entitled \"Bounds for Sorting by Prefix Reversal\" and co-authored with Christos Papadimitriou. Published in 1979, it describes an efficient algorithm for pancake sorting. In addition, the most notable paper published by Futurama co-creator David X. Cohen (as David S. Cohen), co-authored with Manuel Blum, concerned the burnt pancake problem.The connected problems of signed sorting by reversals and sorting by reversals were also studied more recently. Whereas efficient exact algorithms have been found for the signed sorting by reversals, the problem of sorting by reversals has been proven to be hard even to approximate to within certain constant factor, and also proven to be approximable in polynomial time to within the approximation factor 1.375.\n\nPancake graphs\nAn n-pancake graph is a graph whose vertices are the permutations of n symbols from 1 to n and its edges are given between permutations transitive by prefix reversals. It is a regular graph with n! vertices, its degree is n\u22121. The pancake sorting problem and the problem to obtain the diameter of the pancake graph are equivalent.The pancake graph of dimension n, Pn can be constructed recursively from n copies of Pn\u22121, by assigning a different element from the set {1, 2, \u2026, n} as a suffix to each copy.\nTheir girth:\n\ng(Pn)=6, if n>2{\\displaystyle g(P_{n})=6{\\text{, if }}n>2}.The \u03b3(Pn) genus of Pn is:\nn!(n\u221246)+1\u2264\u03b3(Pn)\u2264n!(n\u221234)\u2212n2+1{\\displaystyle n!\\left({\\frac {n-4}{6}}\\right)+1\\leq \\gamma (P_{n})\\leq n!\\left({\\frac {n-3}{4}}\\right)-{\\frac {n}{2}}+1}Since pancake graphs have many interesting properties such as symmetric and recursive structures, small degrees and diameters compared against the size of the graph, much attention is paid to them as a model of interconnection networks for parallel computers. When we regard the pancake graphs as the model of the interconnection networks, the diameter of the graph is a measure that represents the delay of communication.The pancake graphs are Cayley graphs (thus are vertex-transitive) and are especially attractive for parallel processing. They have sublogarithmic degree and diameter, and are relatively sparse (compared to e.g. hypercubes).\n\nAlgorithm\nAn example of the pancake sorting algorithm is given below in Python.

        "body": "Saffranspannkaka or Gotlandspannkaka (English: saffron pancake or Gotland pancake, Gutnish: saffranspannkake or saffranspannkak\u00e5) is a dessert from the island of Gotland, Sweden, and is considered one of their provincial dishes. It is made of rice pudding, cream, milk, sugar, egg, chopped almonds, and saffron mixed together and baked. The cake can be eaten lukewarm or cold and is traditionally served with dewberry jam and whipped cream.\n\nHistory\nThe concept of a saffron pancake has its roots in medieval cuisine, when wealthy households served flavored and coloured rice puddings. Gotland's status as part of the Hanseatic League provided geographical and financial access to exotic spices. The particular combination of rice-almond-saffron-sugar made the dish very exclusive, compared to the saffron bread that has been known since the 16th century.\nOven pancakes, which were mostly served during feasts, have been made on Gotland since the 18th century. They are turned into feast food with the addition of fine flour and eggs. During the 19th century, it became common not only to add sugar to the pancakes, but also saffron and raisins. Today's saffranspannkaka, made with rice pudding that is then baked in an oven, belongs to the class of pudding desserts that became common during the 19th century when the wood stove made cooking easier.\n\nThe saffranspannkaka is associated with Christmas, as it is sometimes made with the leftover Christmas pudding, but during the 19th and 20th century it was also served during anniversaries, weddings, and funerals. The jams eaten with the pancake are also a fashion from the 19th century, when sugar became cheaper. It is today unknown if the saffranspannkaka was created on Gotland, or if someone brought it to the island.During the latter half of the 20th century, the saffranspannkaka have become a well-known tourism symbol for Gotland and is often served at summer-open tourism restaurants and in other contexts where the local island food is highlighted. It has also been named Gotland's provincial dish.\n\n\n== References ==",

The filing is based on cooked potatoes, quark and cooked buckwheat groats (kasha). The other ingredients are: eggs, \u015bmietana (sour cream), fatback or lard, mint (fresh or dried) and spices (salt, black pepper). The kneaded dough is formed into a rectangular or circular shape and baked in oven. Optionally, pier\u00f3g bi\u0142gorajski can be folded in a thin layer of yeast-based dough.The texture of the pier\u00f3g (sing.) is solid, easy to break or crumble, with its appearance resembling that of freshly cooked p\u00e2t\u00e9. May be served hot or cold, with \u015bmietana (sour cream), milk or butter.A Polish dish with a similar taste is kaszak, which is de facto a bread roll infilled with Bi\u0142goraj pierogi.\nSince October 4, 2005 the Bi\u0142goraj pierogi are found on the Polish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's List of Traditional Products.\n\nSee also\nPolish cuisine\nLubelszczyzna cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Originally a traditional condiment from the J\u014detsu region, the name \"kanzuri\" was trademarked in 1966 by the Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. of My\u014dk\u014d, the sole maker of the product.\n\nDescription\nKanzuri is a chili paste with a bright red color. Its texture and flavor are similar to that of yuzu kosh\u014d, which is prepared with the identical principal ingredients, but kanzuri has a milder flavor that is sweeter and less salty. The flavor of kanzuri is also comparable to that of Tabasco sauce or doubanjiang.\n\nProduction\nThe process to make kanzuri typically takes approximately three to four years. The ingredients used are t\u014dgarashi, yuzu, salt, and k\u014dji mold.Production begins in April of the first year with the planting of the t\u014dgarashi used for kanzuri. The particular cultivar used for the making of kanzuri is known as S-30; it is locally grown and about three times larger than other t\u014dgarashi. These S-30 t\u014dgarashi are harvested in the summer. The crop is rinsed with sea water, ground with yuzu and k\u014dji mold, then left to ferment in barrels. In June or July, prior to the onset of peak summer heat, the barrels of fermenting t\u014dgarashi are exposed to the air. This takes place from August until November. During the coldest part of the year, typically around January 20, the t\u014dgarashi are then laid out on snow to dry for several days in a traditional process known as kanzarashi or yukisarashi (Japanese: \u96ea\u3055\u3089\u3057). This is repeated several times until March. Exposure to the snow increases the potency of the t\u014dgarashi's flavor and removes excess salt and bitterness. This process is repeated each year, after which the kanzuri is bottled and shipped to market.Different varieties of kanzuri may take longer to ferment, with one variety taking as long as six years.Kanzuri was trademarked by Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. of My\u014dk\u014d, Niigata in 1966, who later also trademarked the name in China, South Korea, and the United States. They are the exclusive makers of kanzuri.\n\nUses\nTraditionally, people from the J\u014detsu region, which is known in Japan for its heavy snowfall, used kanzuri as a condiment that was thought to help warm up body temperature.Today, kanzuri is used in a wide variety of dishes, including ramen, miso soup, yakiniku, nabemono, natt\u014d, and pasta. It can also be dissolved into wasabi or tare, as well as be eaten as a complement to tsukemono. It is also used as a seasoning in snacks including kaki no tane, senbei, Kappa Ebisen, instant yakisoba, ramen, and chorizo.According to T\u014dj\u014d Kuniaki, the current president of Kanzuri, Co. Ltd., restaurateurs and chefs in Japan often use kanzuri as a \"great supporting actor\" and \"secret ingredient\" in their dishes. They have reported to him that kanzuri helps to mitigate the oiliness of a dish or to brighten its flavor.\n\nHistory\nLocal legend in J\u014detsu ascribes the origin of kanzuri to Uesugi Kenshin, who is said to have introduced t\u014dgarashi to the region from Kyoto. Kanzuri was originally made by grinding t\u014dgarashi together with miso paste.The modern manufacturing of kanzuri began after the Pacific War. At the time, traditional food culture was rapidly disappearing in Japan, which during its postwar economic surge became Westernized. T\u014dj\u014d Kuniji, the founder of what later became the official maker of kanzuri, deplored the situation, and told his son that he had to protect the heritage of kanzuri. He began to research methods of making kanzuri and sought to replicate homemade kanzuri for the domestic market. After graduating high school, his son Kuniaki joined him in his efforts.A breakthrough came when Kuniaki was sent to the United States as part of an agricultural study-abroad program for his university. As he and his fellow students dined on steak on one occasion, he procured a jar of kanzuri that he had brought with him from home. He invited others to try it and their positive reaction strengthened his resolve to popularize kanzuri. When he returned, he co-founded Kanzuri, Co. Ltd. in My\u014dk\u014d with his father and trademarked the name \"kanzuri\".Local elderly women were recruited to help with the manufacturing of kanzuri and produce the right flavor. At first, he sold his kanzuri door-to-door to neighbors. Although his efforts were derided at the time, kanzuri became popular and the company a success. It currently makes approximately 20 tons of kanzuri per year.Both kanzuri and the process of yukisarashi have become popular tourist attractions in My\u014dk\u014d.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nVideo about the making and uses of kanzuri",

Fish amok is believed to have been a royal Khmer dish dating back to the Khmer Empire, although some question it originating in Cambodia.\n\nIngredients\nUsually, goby, snakehead or catfish is used; however, they are also sometimes substituted with cod, snapper, barramundi, salmon, whiting, or perch. The fish fillets are rubbed with or marinated in a freshly-made yellow or green kroeung mixed with coconut cream or coconut milk and eggs. The curry mixture is placed in a banana leaf container with great morinda leaves at the bottom and steamed for around 20 to 30 minutes until the curry achieves a mousse-like consistency. Great morinda leaves can also be substituted with Swiss chard leaves if not available.Fish amok is served hot usually in either banana leaf containers or coconut shells and eaten with steamed rice.\nMany restaurants in Cambodia also serve less traditional versions of amok with chicken, tofu, or beef instead of fish. Other deviations include the use of a store-bought herb paste, other types of kroeung, more liquid consistency and cooking instead of steaming.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nAmok Trei/Fish Amok. 1 May 2021.

        "body": "Lotus seed paste is a Chinese dessert ingredient made from dried lotus seeds.  It is traditionally considered a luxurious ingredient.\n\nProduction\nThe process for making the paste is similar to that of smooth red bean paste. First, the dried seeds are stewed in water until soft prior to being mashed into a fine paste. The paste is then watered down to a thin slurry and passed through a sieve and into cheesecloth, with which it is squeezed dry. This produces a fine crumbly paste, which is then mixed with sugar or other sweeteners and, often, oil to produce a smooth, sweet paste.\n\nUse\nChina\nThe lotus paste used by most Chinese cooks requires further preparation by dry cooking the sweetened paste over heat with caramelized sugar and vegetable oil. This produces a lotus paste that is tan in colour with a satiny sheen. It is also rich, sweet, silky with a slight fragrance of caramel. Some cooks choose to treat the dried lotus seeds with a lye solution before initially stewing them in order to shorten their cooking time.Lotus paste is used in Chinese cuisine as a filling for mooncake, baozi, and other sweet pastries. Another common use of lotus paste is as a filling for lotus seed buns, a dim sum item.Due to the high price of lotus seeds, commercially prepared lotus pastes may also contain white kidney bean paste as its filler. There are several variations, some of which are darker, close to black in color.  These usually have a deeper taste.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nSweet bean paste",

It is the only product sold as Marmite in Australasia and the Pacific Islands, whereas elsewhere in the world the British version predominates.\n\nHistory\nIn the late 19th century  German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled, and eaten. In 1902 the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England with Marmite as its main product and Burton as the site of the first factory.The product's popularity prompted the Sanitarium Health Food Company to obtain sole rights to distribute the product in New Zealand and Australia in 1908. They later began manufacturing Marmite under licence in Christchurch, albeit using a modified version of the original recipe, most notable for its inclusion of sugar and caramel. Common ingredients are also slightly different quantities from the British version; the New Zealand version has high levels of potassium, for example. New Zealand Marmite is described as having a \"weaker\" or \"less tangy\" flavour than the British version. It is distributed throughout Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\n\nUsage\nSanitarium recommends spreading Marmite on bread with potato chips added to make a \"Marmite and Chippie\" sandwich.\n\nNutritional information\nMarmite is rich in B vitamins including thiamin (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), folic acid (B9) and vitamin B12. The sodium content of the spread is high and has caused concern, although it is the amount per serving rather than the percentage in bulk Marmite that is relevant. The main ingredient of Marmite is yeast extract, which contains a high concentration of glutamic acid.\n\nAvailability worldwide\nAs Unilever has the exclusive right to the Marmite name in the United Kingdom, and Sanitarium has the exclusive right to the name in Australia and New Zealand, their respective versions of Marmite must be sold under a different name in the other countries. Unilever International sells the British Marmite as Our Mate in Australia and New Zealand, while Sanitarium sells the New Zealand Marmite as \"NZ-Mite\" in the UK.\nIn November 2008, Marmite was rebranded as 'Mo-mite' in support of Movember, the annual moustache-growing charity event.\n\n2012\u201313 \"Marmageddon\" shortage\nIn November 2011, Sanitarium shut down the sole production line of New Zealand Marmite at its Christchurch factory after a cooling tower at the factory was deemed unsafe, having cracked in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and its aftershocks. On 19 March 2012, the company announced that its own stocks of Marmite had run out and the production line was not expected to be running again until July. Some supermarkets reported at the time they had already run out of stock, and there was only a few weeks' worth of stock left in their distribution centres, leading to the dubbing of Marmite as \"black gold\" and the crisis as \"Marmageddon\".Immediately after the announcement, there was reported panic buying of Marmite from supermarkets, and over one hundred auctions for jars of Marmite, new and used, were listed on online auction site TradeMe, with some sellers asking for up to NZ$800 per jar; over 185 times its usual retail price of around $4.25 per 250 g jar People were advised to use the spread sparingly, with even Prime Minister John Key admitting he might have to switch to Australian rival Vegemite once his personal supplies had run out. Throughout the shortage Marmite ran a number of marketing campaigns on social media which led to a 2,975% increase in fans and a lot of brand exposure.In June 2012, it was announced that additional structural damage had been uncovered at the factory, and the proposed July return to production was rescheduled to October. Problems with an unfinished lift at the factory delayed production into 2013.Sanitarium announced in February 2013 that production had restarted and the factory was in the process of building up stock ready for the return. Marmite returned to New Zealand retailers effective midnight on 20 March 2013, although only the 250 g jar size was initially available and many supermarkets imposed a limit of two jars per customer per day to promote fairness and prevent bulk buying. Supply to overseas retailers resumed after the New Zealand supply and demand settled.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

        "body": "The Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), also known as Boston mackerel, Norwegian mackerel, Scottish mackerel or just mackerel, is a species of mackerel found in the temperate waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the northern Atlantic Ocean, where it is extremely common and occurs in huge shoals in the epipelagic zone down to about 200 m (660 ft). It spends the warmer months close to shore and near the ocean surface, appearing along the coast in spring and departing with the arrival of colder weather in the fall and winter months. During the fall and winter, it migrates out into deeper and more southern water, seeking warmer temperatures.\nThe Atlantic mackerel's body is elongate, steel-blue marked with wavy black lines dorsally and silvery-white ventrally, its snout long and pointed. It possesses two spiny dorsal fins, which are spaced far apart, two pectoral fins, and small caudal and anal fins, also spaced far apart. 4-6 dorsal finlets and 5 anal finlets are typical among members of this species. The fish's body tapers down its length, ending with a large tail fin. Typical size for a mature fish is 30 cm (0.98 ft), but individuals have been caught as large as 60 cm (2.0 ft). The maximum published weight is 3.4 kg (7.5 lb). Reproduction, which is oviparous, occurs near the shore in the spring and summer, during which a female can produce as many as 450,000 eggs. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at around 2 years of age and can live to be 17.\nA highly commercial species, the Atlantic mackerel is sought after for its meat, which is strong in flavor and high in oil content and omega-3 fatty acids among other nutrients. Nearly 1 million tonnes of Atlantic mackerel are caught each year globally, the bulk of which is sold fresh, frozen, smoked, or canned. Despite its highly commercial status, the Atlantic mackerel is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and global catch has remained sustainable.\n\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\nThe Atlantic mackerel was first described in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Linnaeus gave it the scientific name Scomber scomber from the Greek word skombros meaning \"tunny\" or \"mackerel\". Because of its wide distribution, the Atlantic mackerel was independently described 6 more times by 5 different scientists between 1814 and 1863. Its specific name was later changed to scombrus by B. B. Collette and C. E. Nauen in 1983. It is differentiated from its congeners in a number of ways, the first being the absence of a swim bladder. Its palatine bone is also wider than other members of its genus and its otolith is oval-shaped where its congeners' are rectangular.In the eastern Atlantic Ocean there are three stocks differentiated by location and time at which spawning occurs, but studies have not found any distinct genetic differences between these populations. Genetic differences only start to appear at the transatlantic scale, a fact supported by a lack of migration between western and eastern Atlantic populations, whereas eastern Atlantic stocks are known to converge in certain locations like the Norwegian Sea and North Sea.\n\nDescription\nThe Atlantic mackerel has an elongate, fusiform body with a long, pointed snout. The eyes are large and covered by an adipose eyelid, while the teeth are small, sharp, and conical. Scales are also small, with the exceptions of those immediately posterior to the head and around the pectoral fins. These small scales give the Atlantic mackerel a velvet-like feel. The two dorsal fins are large and spaced far apart. The second dorsal fin is typically followed by 5 dorsal finlets, though it can have 4 or 6. The anal fin, which originates slightly behind the second dorsal fin, is similar to it in size and shape and is also succeeded by 5 finlets. The fish's body tapers to a slim caudal peduncle, the end of the fish to which the short but broad tail fin is attached. Its body is steel-blue dorsally with wavy black lines running perpendicular to the fish's length. The rest of its body is silvery-white to yellow and may have darker splotches. It can reach sizes of up to 60 cm (24 in) and has a common length of 30 cm (12 in). Its maximum published weight is 3.4 kg (7.5 lb).\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe Atlantic mackerel's native range in the western Atlantic extends from Labrador, Canada to Cape Lookout, North Carolina. In the eastern Atlantic, it can be found from Iceland and Norway to as far south as Mauritania. It is also found in the Mediterranean, Black, and Baltic Seas. Its latitudinal range is 70\u00b0N-25\u00b0N and its longitudinal range is 77\u00b0W-42\u00b0E. Its preferred water temperature is above 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F), but Atlantic mackerel are common in waters as cold as 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F) and have been found, albeit rarely, in 4.5 \u00b0C (40.1 \u00b0F) waters. The Atlantic mackerel's common depth range extends from the surface to  200 m (660 ft), but individuals can be found as deep as 1,000 m (3,300 ft).Atlantic mackerel are migratory fish, spending the spring and summer closer to shore about 32\u2013161 km (20\u2013100 mi) out, with juveniles moving closer in to shore than adults. Occasionally, fish will even enter harbors, and those that do are usually juveniles. In the fall and winter they move farther out and farther south to the warmer waters on the edge of the continental shelf. They first come in to land in North America in April at the southern end of their range, but are found along the coast through their entire range by July. They start moving back out to sea again in September and are completely gone from the coast by December. Food availability increases greatly during the summer, and fish reach a peak for fat tissue in August, a mere four months after their lowest point in April.\n\nBiology and ecology\nThe Atlantic mackerel is an active, fast-moving fish that must keep in constant motion to bring in enough oxygen to survive. It swims using short movements of the rear of its body and the caudal fin. Unlike other mackerel, Atlantic mackerel do not leap out of the water unless attempting to escape a predator. They form large schools, consisting of individuals of the same relative size, near the ocean surface during all seasons but winter. Because larger fish have a greater ratio of muscle mass to surface area, schools of larger fish are able to swim more quickly than schools made up of smaller individuals.\n\nFeeding\nWhen feeding on larger prey, schools tend to break down into shoals and individuals find food on their own. When consuming plankton, however, Atlantic mackerel form tight aggregations, open their mouths as wide as possible, and extend their operculums, swimming in a tightly packed school that acts like a series of miniature tow nets. Spaced only about the diameter of a single fish's mouth apart, this formation greatly reduces the ability of plankton to evade capture, as a plankton darting out of the way of one fish is likely to end up in the jaws of another. Copepods make up the majority of the Atlantic mackerel's diet, Calanus finmarchicus being the most abundant.\n\nLife history\nLike other mackerels, reproduction in the Atlantic mackerel is oviparous. Spawning occurs day or night in the spring and summer months, primarily within 48 km (30 mi) of shore, though it can occur as far out as 130 km (81 mi). A single female can spawn as many as 450,000 eggs in a spawning season. Eggs mature in batches over the course of a week and are pelagic once released, remaining within 15\u201325 m (49\u201382 ft) of the surface. Time to hatching is dependent on the water temperature, and ranges from 2 days at 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F) to 8.5 days at 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F). Most eggs are spawned in waters 9\u201312 \u00b0C (48\u201354 \u00b0F) in temperature, and as such the majority of eggs hatch in about a week. Eggs are anywhere from 1.0\u20131.3 mm (0.039\u20130.051 in) in size, trending towards smaller as the spawning season goes on. Larvae undergo three developmental stages: the yolk sac stage, the larval stage, and the post-larval stage. Larvae are 3 mm (0.12 in) when they hatch and feed on the yolk sac for about 5 days. During the larval stage, which lasts about a month, larvae grow to 10 mm (0.39 in) in length. They are largely incapable of swimming, instead floating with the current. During the post-larval stage, which occurs over the next 40 days and during which the fish reaches 50 mm (2.0 in) in length, it swims to the surface at night and down to deeper waters during the day. At the end of the post-larval stage, juveniles resemble an adult mackerel in all but size. Schooling behavior occurs around this time.Sexual maturity is reached at around 2 years of age, though some fish may reproduce a season earlier or a season later. Though some fish are sexually mature at 25 cm (9.8 in) in length, even by 34 cm (13 in) only about half of females will be ready to reproduce. At 37 cm (15 in), 90% of fish are capable of reproduction. An Atlantic mackerel can live for up to 17 years and attain a length of 60 cm (24 in) and a weight of 3.4 kg (7.5 lb).\n\nHuman interaction\nThe Atlantic mackerel is of commercial importance to many Atlantic fisheries, which catch it with purse seines, trawls, gill and trammel nets, and trolling lines. Global annual catch is typically in the range of 1 million tonnes, though a 50% spike in 2014 put this number at nearly 1.5 million tonnes. The United Kingdom and Norway bring in the most Atlantic mackerel, with annual catches coming in at over 166,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes respectively. In 2022 alone, Norwegian fisheries exported an estimated 6.3 billion Norwegian Kroner worth of the Atlantic mackerel. The majority of the mackerel caught by Norwegian fisheries is exported to countries including China, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. There are three stocks in the eastern Atlantic: one in the south, one in the west, and another in the North Sea. There are two populations in the Mediterranean, one in the east and one in the west. In the western Atlantic there are two stocks, one in the north and one in the south, for which assessments are, according to the IUCN, \"highly uncertain\".\n\nAs food\nAtlantic mackerel outer meat is red meat while inner meat is white, with a strong taste desirable to some consumers. They are sold fresh, frozen, smoked, salted, filleted, or as steaks. The fish is extremely high in oil content, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, selenium, niacin, and omega 3, a class of fatty acids, containing nearly twice as much of the latter per unit weight as salmon. Unlike the King and Spanish species, Northern Atlantic mackerel are very low in mercury, and can be eaten at least twice a week according to United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.\n\nConservation\nDespite its commercial status, the Atlantic mackerel was assessed to be of Least Concern by the IUCN in 2011. Its abundance and extensive range combined with a cyclical increase/decrease in catch mean that it is not currently in danger of going extinct. The IUCN did recommend careful monitoring, however, especially as the effects of climate change may impact population size and distribution. In the northeastern Atlantic, several countries impose minimum landing sizes. In the European Union this size is 18 cm (7.1 in), Ukraine 15 cm (5.9 in), Turkey 20 cm (7.9 in), Romania 23 cm (9.1 in), and Canada 26.4 cm (10.4 in).\n\nSymbol\nThe Spanish word for mackerel (caballa) is a colloquial demonym for the people of Ceuta, Spain.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDonovan, Moira (18 January 2022). \"Holy Mackerel, Where'd You Go?\".

        "body": "Oxo (stylized OXO) is a brand of food products, including stock cubes, herbs and spices, dried gravy, and yeast extract. The original product was the beef stock cube, and the company now also markets chicken and other flavour cubes, including versions with Chinese and Indian spices. The cubes are broken up and used as flavouring in meals or gravy or dissolved into boiling water to produce a bouillon.\nIn the United Kingdom, the OXO brand belongs to Premier Foods. In South Africa, the Oxo brand is owned and manufactured by Mars, Incorporated and in Canada is owned and manufactured by Knorr.\n\nHistory\nAround 1840, Justus von Liebig developed a concentrated meat extract. Liebig's Extract of Meat Company (Lemco; established in the United Kingdom) promoted it, starting in 1866. The original product was a viscous liquid, containing only meat extract and 4% salt. In 1899, the company introduced the trademark Oxo; the origin of the name is unknown, but presumably comes from the word \"ox.\" Since the cost of liquid Oxo remained beyond the reach of many families, the company launched a research project to develop a solid version that could be sold in cubes for a penny. After much research, Oxo produced their first cubes in 1910 and further increased Oxo's popularity. During World War I, 100 million Oxo cubes were provided to the British armed forces, all of them individually hand-wrapped.The Vestey Group acquired Lemco in 1924, and the factory was renamed El Anglo. Vestey merged with Brooke Bond in 1968, which was in turn acquired by Unilever in 1984. Unilever sold the Oxo brand to the Campbell Soup Company in 2001, and Premier Foods bought Campbell's UK operation in 2006. This sale included sites at both Worksop and Kings Lynn. The Worksop plant currently produces Oxo cubes.\nIn South Africa, Oxo is now a brand of Mars, Incorporated. The only product marketed under the Oxo brand in South Africa was a yeast-extract-based spread. The product also contained a small portion of beef extract, giving it a slightly \"beefier\" taste than other yeast extracts. At the beginning of 2015, Mars Consumer Products Africa (Pty), Ltd discontinued Oxo spread in South Africa, with no prior communication to the public.\n\nMarketing\nIn 1908, Oxo (alongside Odol mouthwash and Indian Foot Powder) was one of the sponsors of the London Olympic Games (despite claims by Coca-Cola of being the \"first\" commercial sponsor of the games) and supplied marathon runners with Oxo drinks \"to fortify them.\" During the first half of the 20th century, Oxo was promoted through the issue of recipes, gifts, and sponsorships, before fading into the background as a part of the fabric of English life in the latter parts of the century.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Liebig's Extract of Meat Company acquired the a Wharf on the south bank of the river Thames in London. There they erected a factory, demolishing most of the original building and constructing a tower, with distinctive windows appearing to spell out 'OXO', which became known as the Oxo TowerIn 1958, Oxo commenced their longest running television advertising campaign, \"Life with Katie.\" Katie was played by Mary Holland, and her long-suffering husband by Peter Moynihan. The campaign ran until the early 1970s, including two seasons where the family traveled to the US to film. By this time, the couple were joined by their \"son.\"\nAs styles and tastes changed, Oxo moved to a more up-to-date format with Dennis Waterman as the sole face of the brand in the mid '70s.\nIn 1966, Oxo had a sponsored show on the offshore radio station, Wonderful Radio London. The show was presented by Tony Windsor; his assistant was a woman called \"Katie.\" Oxo presented a new recipe in each episode.\nOxo launched another long-running advertising campaign in the UK in 1983, when a second \"Oxo Family\" debuted on commercial television.  The father was played by Michael Redfern, the mother was played by Lynda Bellingham, while the children were played by Blair MacKichan, Colin McCoy and Alison Reynolds. The advertisements typically featured the family sitting down to a meal at which Oxo gravy would be served.  The product was not always mentioned by name, occasionally appearing only as a logo in the corner of the screen at the end of the commercial.  Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the family were seen to grow older, and, when the campaign was retired in 1999, the family moved out of the house.\nOn 11 November 2014, it was announced that a 1984 Oxo advert starring Lynda Bellingham would be screened on Christmas Day as a tribute to the actress, who had died of colon cancer the previous month. It was aired during a commercial break of Coronation Street.\n\nSee also\nBovril\nOxo Tower\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nHistory of Campbell Soup UK",

This followed pressure from dairy farmers who did not want peanut butter competing with butter for market share.The product was known in Western Australia and South Australia for many years as peanut paste because, by definition, butter is a dairy product. The same product was available in other states as peanut butter. Manufacturers complained about having to produce different labels for different states and the Western Australian government changed the rules on the use of the word butter to allow for one set of labels.\n\nAs ingredient of peanut butter\nPeanut butter may be made from peanut paste mixed with a stabilizing agent, a sweetening agent, salt, and optionally, an emulsifying agent. In such formulas, peanut paste acts as the main ingredient in peanut butter, from 75% to as much as 99% of the recipe. Peanut butter is mainly known for being sold as a spread, and peanut paste is regularly sold to be used as an ingredient in cookies, cakes and a number of other retail food products.\n\nSee also\nList of peanut dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Tomato paste is a thick paste made from tomatoes, which are cooked for several hours to reduce water content, straining out seeds and skins, and cooking the liquid again to reduce the base to a thick, rich concentrate. It is used to impart an intense tomato flavour to a variety of dishes, such as pasta, soups and braised meat. It is used as an ingredient in many world cuisines.\nBy contrast, tomato pur\u00e9e is a liquid with a thinner consistency than tomato paste, while tomato sauce is even thinner in consistency.\n\nHistory and traditions\nTomato paste is traditionally made in parts of Sicily, southern Italy and Malta by spreading out a much-reduced tomato sauce on wooden boards that are set outdoors under the hot August sun to dry the paste until it is thick enough, when it is scraped up and held together in a richly-colored dark ball. Today, this artisan product is harder to find than the thinner industrial version. Commercial production uses tomatoes with thick pericarp walls and lower overall moisture; these are very different from tomatoes typically found in a supermarket.\nTomato paste became commercially available in the early 20th century.\n\nRegional differences\nIn the UK, tomato paste is also referred to as concentrate. In the US, tomato paste is simply concentrated tomato solids (no seeds or skin), sometimes with added sweetener (high fructose corn syrup), and with a standard of identity (in the Code of Federal Regulations, see 21 CFR 155.191).  Tomato pur\u00e9e has a lower tomato soluble solids requirement, the cutoff being 24%. For comparison, typical fresh round tomatoes have a soluble solid content of 3.5\u20135.5% (refractometric Brix), while cherry tomatoes have double the amount.\n\nUses\nTomato paste is added to dishes to impart an intense flavour, particularly the natural umami flavour found in tomatoes. Examples of dishes in which tomato paste may be commonly used include pasta sauces, soups, and braised meat. The paste is typically added early in the cooking process and saut\u00e9ed to achieve caramelization.Based on the manufacturing conditions, the paste can be the basis for making ketchup or reconstituted tomato juice:\n\nHot break: heated to about 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F), pectin is preserved, paste is thicker and can be used for ketchup\nWarm break: heated to about 79 \u00b0C (174 \u00b0F), colour is not preserved, but flavour is preserved\nCold break: heated to about 66 \u00b0C (151 \u00b0F), colour and flavour are preserved, so it can be reconstituted into juice\n\nSee also\nChili sauce and paste\nList of tomato dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Abu Ghosh (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u063a\u0648\u0634; Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d1\u05d5 \u05d2\u05d5\u05e9) is an Arab-Israeli local council in Israel, located 10 kilometers (6 mi) west of Jerusalem on the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem highway. It is situated 610\u2013720 meters above sea level. It takes its current name from the dominant clan inhabiting the town, while the older Arabic name used to be Qaryat al-'Inab (Arabic: \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0628, lit.\u2009'Grape Village').\n\nHistory\nPrehistory\nAbu Ghosh is located in one of the earliest areas of human habitation in Israel. Archaeological excavations have revealed three Neolithic settlement phases, the middle phase is dated to the 7th millennium BCE.\n\nIdentification with biblical Kiriath-jearim\nThe old Arabic name of Abu Ghosh, Qaryat al-'Inab (Arabic: \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0628, lit.\u2009'Village of the Grapes'), has led to its identification with the biblical site of Kiryat Ye'arim (Hebrew meaning: \"Village of Woods\"), the town to which the Ark of the Covenant was taken after it had left Beth-shemesh (1 Samuel 6:1\u20137:2).Edward Robinson was the first modern scholar to suggest that Qaryat al-'Inab was the biblical Kiriath-jearim. The team excavating the hilltop site of Deir al-'Azar, around the Monastery of Our Lady of the Covenant, lists a wide range of arguments in favour of identifying the site with Kiriath-jearim.In the 19th century, C. R. Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF) thought that the old site of Kiriath-jearim should be identified with Kh. 'Erma, a ruin 2.2 miles (3.5 km) south of Kasla,  4 miles (6.4 km) from Beit Shemesh. Elsewhere, Conder and Kitchener, citing a \"late tradition,\" noted that Abu Ghosh was, by some, thought to be Anathoth, the birthplace of the prophet Jeremiah, a tradition which has since been debunked.\n\nRoman period\nLegio X Fretensis of the Roman army had a station house in Abu Ghosh until the end of the 3rd century CE.\n\nEarly Muslim period\nIn 1047, Nasir Khusraw passed through the village while travelling from Ramla to Jerusalem. He noted: \"By the wayside I noticed, in quantities, plants of rue (Sadab), which grows here of its own accord on these hills, and in the desert places. In the village of Kariat-al-'Anab there is a fine spring of sweet water gushing out from under a stone, and they have placed all around troughs, with small buildings contiguous (for the shelter of travellers).\"\n\nCrusader period\nThe Crusaders, who called the village Fontenoid, believed it was the site of Emmaus mentioned in the Gospel of Luke and built a church there. They later abandoned the identification in favour of Emmaus Nicopolis (see Emmaus#Historical identification).\n\nOttoman period\nIn the early Ottoman census of 16th century, it was noted as Inab, a village located in the nahiya of Quds.There are several versions on the origins of the Abu Gosh clan: According to one version, Abu Ghosh is the name of an Arab family who settled at the location in the early 16th century. According to the Abu Gosh family tradition, they were of Circassian descent, and their founder fought with Selim I. In the 18th century, they lived in a village near Bayt Nuba, from which they ruled the surrounding region. However, according to the tradition, the Banu 'Amir tribesmen and the villagers of Beit Liqya rose against them and slaughtered the entire Abu Ghosh clan except for one woman and her baby, who continued the Abu Ghosh name. Some, however, assert that the Abu Gosh are indeed of North Caucasian traditional descent is correct, but the family is of Ingush origin and that \"Abu Gosh\" is in fact a corruption of \"Abu Ingush\".The Abu Gosh family controlled the pilgrimage route from Jaffa to Jerusalem, and imposed tolls on all pilgrims passing through. They were given this privilege during the sultanate of Suleiman the Magnificent (1494\u20131566). The churches in Jerusalem also paid a tax to the Abu Ghosh clan. In 1834, during Egyptian rule in Palestine, the Egyptian governor Ibrahim Pasha abolished the Abu Ghosh's right to exact tolls from the pilgrimage route and imprisoned the clan's chief, Ibrahim Abu Ghosh, leading to the clan's temporary participation in the countrywide Peasants' Revolt. As a result, their village was attacked by Egyptian military forces.\nIn 1838, it was noted as a Muslim village, named Kuryet el'-Enab, located in the Beni Malik district.It was attacked again in 1853 during a civil war between feudal families under Ahmad Abu Ghosh who ordered his nephew Mustafa to go to battle. A third attack on Abu Ghosh, carried out by the Ottoman military forces, helped and executed by British forces, took place during the military expedition against the feudal families in the 1860s. The Abu Ghoshes were among the well-known feudal families in Palestine. They governed 22 villages. The sheikh of Abu Ghosh lived in an impressive house described by pilgrims and tourists as a \"true palace ... a castle ... a protective fortress ...\"An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Abu Ghosh had 148 houses and a population of 579, though the population count included men only.In the 19th century, the village was also referred to as Kuryet el' Enab.In 1896 the population of Abu Ghosh was estimated to be about 1,200 persons.At the beginning of the 20th century Qariat el-'Inab functioned as a 'throne village', or local seat of power.Kiryat Anavim, the first kibbutz in the Judean Hills, was founded near Abu Ghosh in 1914, on land purchased from the Abu Ghosh family.\n\nBritish Mandate\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Enab had a population 475, 450 Muslims and 25 Christians, increasing in the 1931 census to 601; 576 Muslims and 25 Christians, in 138 houses.When Chaim Weizmann, later the first president of the State of Israel, visited Palestine in the spring of 1920, he was hosted by the residents of Abu Ghosh. From the early 20th century, the leaders of Abu Ghosh worked together and were on friendly terms with the Zionist leaders, and local Jews.In the 1945 Village Statistics the population of Qaryat el 'Inab (Abu Ghosh) was 860; 820 Muslims and 40 Christians, with a total of 7,590 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 1,517 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,274 for cereals, while 21 dunams were built-up (urban) land.During the 1947\u201348 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the road to Jerusalem was blocked for Jews, as passage through the hills surrounding Jerusalem was crucial for getting supplies to the Jewish parts of the besieged city. Of the 36 Arab Muslim villages in these hills, Abu Ghosh was the only one that remained neutral, and in many cases helped to keep the road open for Jewish convoys. \"From here it is possible to open and close the gates to Jerusalem,\" said former President Yitzhak Navon. Many in Abu Ghosh helped Israel with supplies.During Operation Nachshon the Haganah reconsidered an attack on Abu Ghosh due to opposition of the Lehi, whose local commanders were on good terms with the mukhtar (village chief).\n\nIsrael\n1948 war\nDuring the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the Har'el Brigade headquarters were located in Abu-Ghosh. Many of the villagers left Abu Ghosh during the heavy fighting in 1948, but most returned home in the following months.\nThe Israeli government, subsequently on peaceful terms with the village, invested in improving the infrastructure of the village.Abu Ghosh mayor Salim Jaber attributed in 2007 the good relations with Israel to the great importance attached to being hospitable: \"We welcome anybody, regardless of religion or race.\" According to a village elder interviewed by The Globe and Mail: \"Perhaps because of the history of feuding with the Arabs around us we allied ourselves with the Jews ... against the British. We did not join the Arabs from the other villages bombarding Jewish vehicles in 1947. The Palmach fought many villages around us. But there was an order to leave us alone. The other Arabs never thought there would be a Jewish government here. ... During the first truce of the War of Independence, I was on my way to Ramallah to see my father and uncles, and I was captured by Jordanian soldiers. They accused me of being a traitor and tortured me for six days.\"\n\nMartial law (1949\u20131966)\nDuring the early years of the State of Israel the village was subjected to repeated searches by the army and anyone who had not registered as resident in November 1948 could be expelled. One case attracted a lot of public criticism. In June 1950, the IDF and police deported 105 men and women believed to be \"infiltrators\" to Jordan. In an open letter to the Knesset, the inhabitants of Abu Ghosh claimed that the army had \"surrounded our village, and taken our women, children and old folk, and thrown them over the border and into the Negev Desert, and many of them died in consequence, when they were shot [trying to make their way back across] the borders.\" The letter further stated that they woke up to \"shouts blaring over the loudspeaker announcing that the village was surrounded and anyone trying to get out would be shot. ... The police and military forces then began to enter the houses and conduct meticulous searches, but no contraband was found. In the end, using force and blows, they gathered up our women, and old folk and children, the sick and the blind and pregnant women. These shouted for help but there was no saviour. And we looked on and were powerless to do anything save beg for mercy. Alas, our pleas were of no avail... They then took the prisoners, who were weeping and screaming, to an unknown place, and we still do not know what befell them.\"Knesset member Moshe Erem accused the army of excessive force, a charge that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion denied. He also defended the policy of expulsions. Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett, concerned about international reaction, argued that there should be more searches with fewer people being deported at one time and then only adult males. One of the issues causing concern in this case was that some of those expelled had been resident in Abu Ghosh for over a year. In the wake of public pressure, the vast majority of villagers were allowed to return. In July 1952, MK Beba Idelson objected to the deportation of an Abu Ghosh woman, who was said to have cancer, and her four children. The police minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit rejected the claim that the woman had cancer. The village remained under martial law until 1966.\n\n21st century\nIn 2017, Abu Ghosh was described as a \"model of coexistence.\"\n\nArchaeology\nIn 2017 an archaeological dig began at Deir el-'Azar, the site of the convent, led by Israel Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University and Christophe Nicolle and Thomas R\u00f6mer of the College de France. The first season brought to light a huge, 110 by 150 metres stone platform or podium at the top of the hill, with retaining walls 3 m thick, 6 to 7 metres high and perfectly aligned north\u2013south and east\u2013west, which were dated to the first half of the eighth century BCE during the Iron IIB period (900\u2013700 BCE). Finkelstein attributed the ancient structure to King Jeroboam II of the northern Kingdom of Israel, seeing in it a sign of its dominance over the southern Kingdom of Judah and its capital, Jerusalem. He speculated that the platform might have housed an administration compound that included a temple of the Ark, with the aim of enforcing the domination of Israel over Judah.The hilltop shows signs of intensive settlement activity during the Iron IIC period (700\u2013586 BCE), when the rectangular podium at the summit was reconstructed. Renewed reconstruction of the podium took place in the late Hellenistic period, possibly as part of the fortification works undertaken by the Seleucid general Bacchides. In the first century CE it seems that the flat hilltop was used as a Roman camp by the Xth Roman legion, Fretensis, for which reason the Romans extended the platform to create a perfectly square, 150 by 150 metres base for their fortified camp. From the Byzantine period remains of a basilica were discovered, possibly dating to the 5th century. The Arabic name Deir el-\u02bfAzar, lit. \"Monastery of el-\u02bfAzar\" may be a corruption of Eleazar, leading to the theory that it was named after the high priest who was charge of the Ark while it was at Kiriath-jearim (1 Sam 7:1). This monastery seems to have functioned to the end of the Byzantine and maybe into the beginning of the Early Islamic period, since very few pottery sherds were found from a later period.\n\nLocal government\nAbu Ghosh is governed by a local council, and is part of the Jerusalem District. The current mayor of Abu Ghosh is Salim Jaber. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Abu Ghosh had a population of 7,942 in 2022.\n\nReligious sites\nBenedictine St Mary of the Resurrection Abbey\nThe Crusader church at the historical entrance to the village, now at the centre of the Benedictine Monastery, is one of the best preserved Crusader remains in the country. The Hospitallers had built this late Romanesque/early Gothic church in 1140 and it was partially destroyed in 1187. It was acquired by the French government in 1899 and placed under guardianship of the French Benedictine Fathers. Since 1956, it has been run by the Lazarist Fathers. Today a double community of nuns and brothers continue the worship in the church and offer hospitality, reflecting the ancient story of the couple on the Jerusalem\u2013Emmaus road. Edward Robinson (1838) described it as \"obviously from the time of the crusades, and [...] more perfectly preserved than any other ancient church in Palestine.\" Excavations carried out in 1944 confirm that the Crusaders identified the site as the biblical Emmaus. The church is now known as both Church of the Resurrection and Emmaus of the Crusaders.\n\nChurch of Notre Dame\nThe Church of Notre Dame de l'Arche d'Alliance (Our Lady of the Ark of the Covenant Church), built in 1924, is said to occupy the site of the house of Abinadab, where the Ark of the Covenant rested for twenty years until King David took it to Jerusalem. It is built on the site of a fifth-century Byzantine church, from which a 5th-century mosaic floor was preserved. The church is recognizable by the roof-top statue of Mary carrying the infant Jesus in her arms.\n\nAbu Ghosh mosques\nAbu Ghosh's historic mosque is in the town center, near the Crusader church, and is dedicated to Uzair-biblical Ezra (Quran 9:30). The new Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque, completed in 2014, is the largest mosque in Israel and was built with money donated by the Chechen government.\n\nMusic and culture\nThe Abu Gosh Music Festival is held twice a year, in the fall and late spring, with musical ensembles and choirs from Israel and abroad performing in and around the churches in Abu Ghosh. The monks believe that holding concerts on the grounds of their churches is a \"fine symbol of friendship and welcome. Jews coming to a Muslim community to hear music in a Christian church...is a small, white pebble in the path that we want.\"\n\nLocal cuisine\nAbu Ghosh is popular among Palestinians and Israelis for its Middle Eastern restaurants and hummus.In 2007, Abu Ghosh was described as the \"hummus capital of Israel.\" In January 2010, Abu Ghosh secured the Guinness World Record for preparing the largest dish of hummus in the world. Jawdat Ibrahim, owner of Abu Ghosh hummus restaurant, organized the event, which brought together 50 Jewish and Israeli-Arab chefs. The winning 20-foot (6.1 m) dish weighed 4,087.5 kilograms (8992.5 pounds), about twice as much as the previous record set by Lebanon in October 2009. In May 2010, Lebanon regained the Guinness World Record, more than doubling Abu Ghosh's January 2010 total.\n\nChametz ceremony\nSince 1997, Jaaber Hussein, a Muslim Arab-Israeli hotel food manager from Abu Ghosh, has signed an agreement with Israel's Chief Rabbis to purchase all of the state's chametz, the leavened products not kosher for the Jewish holiday of Passover. This contractually binding deal allows the state to respect religious edicts without wastefully destroying massive quantities of food. In 2009, Hussein put down a cash deposit of $4,800 (about 20,000 shekels) for $150 million worth of chametz, acquired from state companies, the prison service and the national stock of emergency supplies. At the end of Passover each year, the deposit is returned to Hussein and the State of Israel buys back all the food products.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nArab localities in Israel\nList of modern names for biblical place names\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome To Qaryet al-'Inab/Abu Goush\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 17: IAA, Wikimedia commons",

        "body": "West Bank Story is a 2005 American musical comedy short film directed by Ari Sandel, co-written by Sandel and Kim Ray, produced by Pascal Vaguelsy, Amy Kim, Ashley Jordan, Ravi Malhotra, Bill Boland, and featuring choreography by Ramon Del Barrio. The film is a parody of the classic 1961 musical film West Side Story, which in turn is an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. The film follows the rivalry between falafel restaurants, one Israeli and the other Palestinian, respectively named the \"Kosher King\" and the \"Hummus Hut,\" and the romance between the latter's cashier and an Israeli soldier in the West Bank. The film stars Ben Newmark as the IDF soldier, Noureen DeWulf as the Palestinian cashier, A.J. Tannen as the Israeli restaurant owner, and Joey Naber as his Palestinian rival.\nFilmed on a Santa Clarita, California ranch, the short premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, and was screened at numerous additional film festivals across the world, garnering several awards. In 2007, at the 79th Academy Awards, it won the Oscar in the category Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with a scene in which the Palestinians and Jews are both snapping their fingers, similar to the opening scene of West Side Story. The two parties head to their own family-owned falafel stands (Hummus Hut and Kosher King) where they sing \"Our People Must Be Fed/Our People Must Be Served\". During the day, Hummus Hut employee Fatima and Israeli soldier David are daydreaming about each other (in the romantic duet, \"When I See Him\"). When Fatima rushes to give a customer his forgotten leftovers, she has a chance encounter with David, and they realize their mutual attraction.\nUpon returning to the shop, Fatima's brother shows her that the Kosher King Jews have a machine that encroaches a few inches onto their property. The head of Hummus Hut throws a rock into the machine, making it malfunction, provoking a standoff between the two families (resolved by David and Fatima). Ariel, head of the Kosher King, decides he is going to build a wall. After they leave, David and Fatima stay, and David indicates he'll come to her balcony that night.\nThe construction begins, and the Palestinians plan to end it abruptly (\"We're Gonna Build It\"). As such happens, David goes to Fatima's house (\"This Moment Is All We Have\"), wanting to kiss her, but Fatima refuses, saying it will only escalate the conflict. They head over to stop the fight. As they do, it is revealed to Fatima's family that they are in love. The following fight tips over a canister of gasoline, causing the entire stand to catch fire. David goes to warn the Israelis, who celebrate - until an ember reaches the Kosher King, which proceeds to catch on fire. As the Hummus Hut denizens celebrate, Fatima points out to everyone that they are only making their lives worse.\nThe next morning, expectant falafel customers are oblivious to the fire, and still want food. Ahmed and Ariel have nothing, but David and Fatima scrape together some of the remaining food, merging the two falafel stands. After the others are working, David and Fatima kiss. At the very end, Fatima asks what will happen if their families cannot stop fighting. David says he will \"take you to a place called... Beverly Hills\", alluding to the song \"Somewhere\" in West Side Story.\n\nAwards\nAcademy Awards\nLive Action Short Film 2006\nNow Film Festival\nFinalist\nIndianapolis International Film Festival\nAudience Award - Best Short\nMalibu Film Festival\nSpecial Jury Award - Best Live Action Short Film\nMethod Fest\nSpecial Mention\nStony Brook Film Festival\nFestival Grand Prize\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 2005\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nWest Bank Story at IMDb \n79th Annual Academy Awards\nInterview feature by CNN International's Inside the Middle East (video)",

        "body": "Harissa (Arabic: \u0647\u0631\u064a\u0633\u0629 har\u012bsa, from Maghrebi Arabic) is a hot chili pepper paste, native to the Maghreb. The main ingredients are roasted red peppers, Baklouti peppers (\u0628\u0642\u0644\u0648\u0637\u064a), spices and herbs such as garlic paste, caraway seeds, coriander seeds, cumin and olive oil to carry the oil-soluble flavors.Tunisia is the biggest exporter of prepared harissa and UNESCO lists it as part of Tunisia's Intangible Cultural Heritage. The origin of harissa goes back to the importation of chili peppers into Maghrebian cuisine by the Columbian exchange, presumably during the Spanish occupation of Ottoman Tunisia between 1535 and 1574.\n\nEtymology\nThe word derives from the Arabic root 'harasa' (Arabic: \u0647\u0631\u0633) 'to pound, to break into pieces', referring to pounding chilis, a tool traditionally used to make the paste in the Maghreb is called Mehraz, and similar names are used for other pastes in the Maghrebi cuisine, such as \"Hrous\" which uses the same harissa recipe with a slight difference in the peppers, which are green.\n\nConsumption and culinary traditions\nAlgeria\nIn Algeria, harissa is commonly added to soups, stews, and couscous. Harissa paste can also be used as a rub for meat or eggplants. Another significant producer is Algeria's Annaba Province, which is also a significant consumer. According to cookbook author Martha Rose Shulman, premade harissa tastes rather different from that which is  served in Tunisian and expatriate restaurants.\n\nIsrael and Libya\nIn Israel, harissa is a common topping for sabich and shawarma. \nFilfel chuma (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05dc\u05e4\u05dc\u05e6'\u05d5\u05de\u05d4\u200e), also spelled pilpelshuma, literally \"pepper garlic\", is the typical chili sauce of Libyan Jewish cuisine which is very similar to the harissa. It comes from Libyan cuisine, where it is known as maseer (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u064a\u0631 or \u0645\u0633\u0651\u064a\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0631 mseyer). It is also known by other names such as filfil mukhalal (\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644 \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0644) and filfil makbos (\u0641\u0644\u0641\u0644 \u0645\u0643\u0628\u0648\u0633). It is made from powdered sweet and hot peppers and crushed garlic. Other ingredients, such as ground caraway seeds, cumin, lemon juice, and salt are sometimes added. It serves as a condiment and as an ingredient in dishes such as salads, meat, fish, legumes and rice, and egg dishes such as shakshouka.\n\nMorocco\nMoroccan cuisine has also adopted harissa, and some Moroccans use it as a side condiment for tagines, or sometimes mixed into dishes. Moroccans tend to have a preference for less seasoned harissa as it allows them to incorporate it into dishes of different flavor profiles.\n\nTunisia\nRecipes for harissa vary according to the household and region.  Variations can include the addition of fermented onions or lemon juice. Prepared harissa is sold in jars, cans, bottles and tubes. Harissa is sometimes described as \"Tunisia's main condiment\", even \"the national condiment of Tunisia\", or at least as \"the hallmark of Tunisia's fish and meat dishes\". In Tunisia, harissa is used as an ingredient in a meat (poultry, beef, goat, or lamb) or fish stew with vegetables, and as a flavoring for couscous. It is also used for lablabi, a chickpea soup, and fricasse.\nTunisia is the biggest exporter of prepared harissa. In 2006, the Tunisian production of harissa was 22,000 tonnes, incorporating about 40,000 tonnes of peppers. Tunisian harissa is often made with Baklouti peppers and chilis grown around Nabeul and Gab\u00e8s, which are relatively mild, scoring 4,000\u20135,000 on the Scoville scale. On December 1 2022, UNESCO added \"Harissa, knowledge, skills and culinary and social practices\" as part of Tunisia's Intangible Cultural Heritage.\n\nSee also\n\nZhug\nMuhammara\nAjika\nChermoula\nTabil\nGochujang\nEr\u0151s Pista\nBiber sal\u00e7as\u0131\nList of sauces\nSeasoning\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Hrous, or hrouss, is a Tunisian spicy chili pepper paste condiment.\nTwo types exist: The first one, a simple paste prepared from fresh chili peppers with a few spices., is most prevalent in the North-East, while the second type is the hrouss specific to the Gabes region, prepared with equal portions of salt-pickled onions and dried chili pepper powder.\n\nEtymology\nThe name of the condiment comes from the Arabic verb harasa (Arabic: \u0647\u0631\u0633) meaning \"to crush\" or \"mash\", hrous means literally \"what is mashed\".\nThe two types of Tunisian hrous differ from the Tunisian harissa, because harissa is prepared using dry peppers (instead of fresh ones) and some spices but never includes onions (unlike the hrous from Gabes).\n\nNord-Eastern and commercial large-scale produced hrous\nThis first sort of hrous consists of chopped fresh spicy peppers (either all red or a mix of red and green peppers), to which are added pureed garlic, ground coriander seeds, ground carraway seeds and some salt. It can be eaten immediately.This hrous, sometimes called Nebli (i.e., from the city of Nabeul), to differentiate it from the Gabes recipe, can be prepared at any time of the year in the family kitchen but can also be bought by weight in local delis or in glass jars or cans as it is produced industrially on a large scale by several companies,. This hrous is used to spice the lablabi but also rice, pasta and couscous dishes as well as soups with meat, poultry, fish or shellfish,.\n\nPreparation of the Gabes hrous\nIn summer, red onions are cut in squares or thin strips and kneaded with salt (to which a small amount of turmeric is sometimes added) before being firmly packed in a jar. The mix is regularly shaken (without opening the jar) until September, when red peppers become abundant in Tunisia. The fresh red peppers are quickly rinsed, their inner seeds are discarded, and the peppers are dried, traditionally by exposing them to the sun. Once dried, the peppers are crushed or more commonly today, taken to the small shops where they can be ground on demand.The hrous is then prepared by mixing an equal volume of the dried powdered red chili peppers and a volume of the onions and salt (with the juice that they may have released). Both are kneaded together to give a cohesive wet-sand or paste-like texture. Olive oil is added to the mix which is kneaded again, then firmly packed in containers to which some olive oil is added on top to ensure long term room-temperature storage of the hrous. The paste should be allowed to rest for at least a week, preferentially at least a month of maturing before using it,Some families add to the mix various spices such as cinnamon, ground coriander seeds or powdered dried rose buttons but these additional spices restrict the use of the condiment paste to some specific types of dishes.The hrous from Gabes can be bought in some food stores all over Tunisia but most of it is produced within the home environment in the region around Gabes, where it is a required component of local dishes. The hrous from Gabe is used in soups, meat, poultry and fish dishes (for example stuffed squid) as well as various types of couscous.\n\n\n== References ==",

Jeow Bong is made with sundried chilies, galangal, garlic, fish sauce and other ingredients commonly found in Laos. Its distinguishing ingredient, however, is the addition of shredded water buffalo or pork skin.\nJeow bong was one of the favorite dishes of the former Lao royal family as described in the collection of recipes hand-written by Phia Sing (1898-1967), the king's personal chef and master of ceremonies. Today, Jeow bong is one of several popular traditional dishes of Laos that is also gaining popularity in the West.It is eaten usually by dipping Lao sticky rice or a raw/parboiled vegetable in it. It's also a condiment for a Lao riverweed snack called Kaipen. Jeow bong lasts for a long time, does not spoil easily and can be either on the spicier or sweeter side, depending who makes it. Characteristically, it is both sweet and spicy.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nNam phrik phao\nChili pepper paste\n\n\n== References ==",

Suya is generally made with skewered beef, ram, or chicken. Organ meats such as kidney, liver and tripe are also used.

Suya is traditionally served with an extra helpings of dried pepper mixed, traditional hausa spices, and sliced onions. It is also traditionally served in Hausa culture with a side serving of Hausa Masa (fermented rice/grain/corn cakes). Halal meat preparation methods are normally used, especially in the northern parts of Nigeria where it originates as is customary with traditional Hausa foods, where the suspicion of nonconformity to Muslim dietary prohibitions in Suya preparation has been known to cause riots. A dried version of Suya is called Kilishi. It can be eaten with Masa, Kosai, Garri or Ogi.\n\nThere is no standard recipe for composing the complex mixture of spices and additives which make up the Suya marinade (called Yaji) and the spice mix served alongside it.  Ingredients may vary according to personal and regional preferences.Although Suya is a traditional Hausa Nigerian dish, it has permeated the Nigerian society, being affordable for all and available everywhere. It has been called a unifying factor in Nigeria. Suya has become a Nigerian national dish, with different regions claiming the superiority of their recipe and methods of preparation, but similar grilled meat recipes are common in many West African countries.\n\nSee also\nDibi\nKyinkyinga\nList of African dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSuya Meat and Vendor (Photograph), News Agency of Nigeria.\nSuya recipe",

        "body": "In Ghanaian cuisine, banku and akple ( ) are swallow dishes made of a slightly fermented cooked mixture of maize and cassava doughs formed into single-serving balls.\nBanku is cooked in hot water until it turns into a smooth, whitish paste, served with soup, okra stew or a pepper sauce with fish.Akple is preferred by the people of the southern regions of Ghana\u2014the Ewe people, the Fante people and the Ga-Dangme\u2014but it is also eaten across other regions in Ghana. Banku is a softer variety eaten by the Ga-Dangme (or Ga), while the Fante people also have a drier variant of the dish they call \u025btsew.\n\nEtymology\nBanku is a distinctively Ga-Dangme term. Banku is coined from the Krobo phrase \"ba mi ku\". Ba means 'leaf(ves)'. Ku is the  generic Ga-Dangbe term for all food of similar texture and prepared in a similar manner.  Historically, banku was stored in leaves. The phrase ba mi ku simply means ku in leaves, and has been adulterated over time into banku. There are similar tonal terms with different meaning in the Ga language, such as Inku (for pomade in the Ga-language), Ashanku (for a variant of a plantain fritter called Tatale), and many other names ending in 'ku'.\n\nIngredients and preparation\nThe main ingredients for preparing banku are corn flour, cassava, salt and water. Banku and akple are made with similar ingredients.Cassava is peeled, chopped and mixed with corn grains and soaked for a day. The water is poured off and the cassava and maize are milled into a smooth, fine and wet dough. The dough is then fermented for two to five days, depending on temperature.The corn and cassava dough is mixed with water and then boiled. The mixture is stirred gradually until the slurry becomes dough-like again and is then kneaded until it is smooth. Water is added around the \"dough-in-pan-island\", enough to almost cover the surface. It then needs to be covered well and allowed to boil, ensuring even cooking and steaming of the dough in the covered pan. Next, the dough is kneaded with a spatula to incorporate the water into it until it is smooth. \nThe process is repeated with centering, watering, and kneading until the dough is soft and evenly cooked. The cooked dough is portioned into small balls.\nBanku and akple are traditionally eaten with hands. Akple is usually eaten with an okro (okra) soup known as Fetri Detsi among the Ewes. It can be served with soup, stew or pepper sauce with meat or fish.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nVideo: How to Prepare Banku\nAkple (corn and cassava dough) \nVideo:  How To Make Akple & Abobi (Keta school boys ) Pepper Sauce",

Funge is a staple food in African cuisine. Some richer and more flavorful versions may be made with stock, like fish stock, instead of water. It is also known as bidia (literally \"food\").Funge is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying stew, side dish or sauce.\nFunge is a traditional staple in Angolan cuisine. In the Lesser Antilles, a similar food is known as fungi or cou-cou.\nIn Ghana there are two variations, usually made with ground corn, though the variation known as banku is sometimes made from a mixture of grated cassava and corn. The corn is allowed to ferment before it is cooked. To make banku the fermented mixture is cooked in a pot, but the variation called kenkey is only partially cooked before it is wrapped in banana leaves or corn husks and steamed.\nIn Brazilian cuisine, a similar dish made with cassava flour and fish stock is known as pir\u00e3o.\n\n\n== References ==",

Because hazelnuts were not common in the US, pecans were used, and it came to be known as Huguenot torte.

        "body": "Negitoro (Japanese: \u30cd\u30ae\u30c8\u30ed) is a Japanese cuisine of minced raw tuna scrape, the fatty parts of the fish that cannot be made into other meals, commonly served together with green onion. In addition to being an ingredient to sushi of various types, they are used as a rice bowl topping, forming negitorodon.\n\nEtymology\nMultiple hypotheses exist.\n\nCombination of green onion and toro part of tuna\nNegitoro is so named because it is a combination of green onion (Japanese: \u30cd\u30ae, romanized: Negi), and toro (Japanese: \u30c8\u30ed, romanized: toro, fatty parts of tuna).Since the 1980s, with the appearance of new toro sushi combined with pungent vegetables, the well-matched taste and combination of toro, green onion and nori seaweed have become popular.\n\nToro referring to something other than part of tuna\nOne of the restaurants hypothesized as the origin of the dish claims the dish was so named based on mugitoro, a dish that was popular around the place at the time.\n\nNegi referring to something other than green onion\nIn the field of construction in Japan, digging soil from the ground to constructing building is termed negiru (Japanese: \u6839\u5207\u308b), and it was hypothesized that the term adopted into negiru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u308b) or negitoru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u53d6\u308b) to refer to meat being scraped. Tuna fishing groups support the hypothesis. However, dictionary editors question the hypothesis, claiming there is no verifiable usage of the verb form of the adopted word negitoru (Japanese: \u306d\u304e\u53d6\u308b), and thus the hypothesis cannot be sustained. It has been suggested the negitoru origin hypothesis emerged after the 2000s, and until the 1990s the mainstream hypothesis on the origin of the negitoro dish was that the term is a combination of green onion (Japanese: \u30cd\u30ae, romanized: Negi) and toro (Japanese: \u30c8\u30ed, romanized: toro).\n\nMass-market product\nNegitoro sold to the mass market and distributed into retail channels like supermarkets is mass-produced in fish factories. They use lean meat of various fishes, including, for example, yellowfin tuna, marlin, bigeye tuna, and albacore,  then adding additives like vegetable oil, shortening, lard, antioxidants, and condiments. Dedicated fat products for the purpose of negitoro manufacturing have also been produced.Japanese consumer groups and magazines have raised concerns about such practices being possibly misleading and raising potential health concerns. However, there are also claims that unprocessed tuna scrape is not popular.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nAsahiya Publishing, ed. (1978). \u3059\u3057\u306e\u96d1\u8a8c\u7b2c6\u96c6.

        "body": "Raw milk or unpasteurized milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, a process of heating liquid foods to kill pathogens for safe consumption and extending the shelf life.Proponents of raw milk have asserted numerous supposed benefits to consumption, including better flavor, better nutrition, contributions to the building of a healthy immune system and protection from allergies. However, no clear benefit to consumption has been found, and the medical community notes there is increased risk of contracting dangerous milk borne diseases from these products. Substantial evidence of this increased risk, combined with a lack of any clear benefit, has led countries around the world to either prohibit the sale of raw milk or require warning labels on packaging when sold.\nIn countries where it is available for sale, its availability and regulations around its sale vary. In the European Union, individual member states can prohibit or restrict the sale of raw milk, but it is not banned outright; in some member states, the sale of raw milk through vending machines is permitted, though the packaging will typically instruct consumers to boil before consumption. In the United States, some dairies have adopted low-temperature vat pasteurization, which they say produces a product similar to raw milk.\n\nHistory of raw milk and pasteurization\nHumans first learned to regularly consume the milk of other mammals following the domestication of animals during the Neolithic Revolution or the development of agriculture. This development occurred independently in several places around the world from as early as 9000\u20137000 BC in Mesopotamia to 3500\u20133000 BC in the Americas. The most important dairy animals\u2014cattle, sheep and goats\u2014were first domesticated in Mesopotamia, although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since. From there dairy animals spread to Europe (beginning around 7000 BC but not reaching Britain and Scandinavia until after 4000 BC), and South Asia (7000\u20135500 BC).\nPasteurization is widely used to prevent infected milk from entering the food supply. The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage.\nAfter sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s. This move successfully controlled the spread of highly contagious bacterial diseases including E. coli, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis (all thought to be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk). In the early days after the scientific discovery of bacteria, there was no product testing to determine whether a farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk was treated as potentially contagious. After the first tests were developed, some farmers took steps to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, sometimes even falsifying test results to make their animals appear free of infection. Recent advances in the analysis of milk-borne diseases have enabled scientists to track the DNA of the infectious bacteria to the cows on the farms that supplied the raw milk.The recognition of many potentially deadly pathogens, such as E. coli 0157 H7, Campylobacter, Listeria, and Salmonella, and their possible presence in poorly produced milk products has led to the continuation of pasteurization. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies of the United States strongly recommend that the public do not consume raw milk or raw milk products. Young children, the elderly, people with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women are more susceptible to infections originating in raw milk.\n\nUses\nA number of cheeses are produced with raw milk although local statutes vary regarding what if any health precautions must be followed such as aging cheese for a certain amount of time. A large proportion of the US population eats several different cheeses made with raw milk, including aged Gouda cheese.\nThe first camembert was made from raw milk, and the Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) variety \"Camembert de Normandie\" (approximately 10% of all camembert production) is required by law to be made only with unpasteurized milk. Many modern cheesemakers, however, use pasteurized milk for reasons of safety, compliance with regulations, or convenience.A thick mixture known as syllabub was created by milkmaids squirting milk directly from a cow into a container of cider, beer or other beverage.Raw yak milk is allowed to ferment overnight to become yak butter.\n\nHealth effects\nInfectivity\nThe potential pathogenic bacteria from raw milk include tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid, Campylobacter, Listeria, Brucella, E. coli, Salmonella, and streptococcal infections, make it potentially unsafe to consume. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that \"raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption.\"Even with precautions and cold storage (optimally 3\u20134 \u00b0C (37\u201339 \u00b0F)), raw milk has a shelf life of 3 to 5 days.\n\nEpidemiology\nBefore pasteurized milk was adopted in the US, public health officials were concerned with cow milk transmission of bovine tuberculosis to humans, with an estimated 10% of all tuberculosis cases in humans being attributed to milk consumption. Along with specific diseases, officials continue to be concerned about outbreaks. With the use of modern pasteurization and sanitation practices milk accounts for less than 1% of reported outbreaks from food and water consumption. By comparison, raw milk was associated with 25% of all disease outbreaks from food/water during the time before World War II in the U.S. From a public health standpoint, pasteurization has decreased the percentage of milk associated food/water borne outbreaks.\nBetween 2007 and 2016, there were 144 outbreaks connected to raw milk consumption in the United States. Because raw milk production skips the pasteurization process, the germs that are normally removed remain in the milk product. Exposure to raw milk containing harmful germs poses a threat of infection, resulting from bacteria including Camplyobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella. Additionally, depending on the severity of infection, there may be further threat to human health. Infection has the potential to induce serious illness such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Because of the vulnerability of developing and degrading immune systems, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised are at a heightened risk of experiencing infection from raw milk consumption.Outbreaks have occurred in the past from consuming food products made with raw milk. One of the potential pathogens in raw milk, Listeria monocytogenes, can survive the pasteurization process and contaminate post-pasteurization environments. Milk and dairy products made with that milk then become recontaminated. Consistent contamination persists by bacteria survival in biofilms within the processing systems.\nOne food item that has commonly used raw milk in its production in the past is cheese. Several different types of cheeses made with raw milk are consumed by a large portion of the United States population, including soft cheeses. Since Gouda cheese has a 60-day aging period prior to its consumption, it has previously been hypothesized that no bacteria would persist through that time. A review study published in the Journal of Food Protection showed that E. coli 0157:H7 has the ability to persist through the aging period of Gouda cheese. The study's evidence included three different outbreaks prior to 2013 associated with this specific strain of E. coli in Gouda.\n\nNutrition and allergy\n\"With the exception of an altered organoleptic [flavor] profile, heating (particularly ultra-high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\"Raw milk advocates, such as the Weston A. Price Foundation, say that raw milk can be produced hygienically, and that it has health benefits that are destroyed in the pasteurization process. Research shows only very slight differences in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk.Proponents of raw milk in the US typically argue that while pasteurization may kill dangerous bacteria, it also kills off good bacteria claimed to have health benefits not present in pasteurized milk. The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that this is false, and that pasteurizing milk does not destroy any of its nutritional value.One study used mice to evaluate the difference in nutritional values between raw and pasteurized milk. Mice were separated into two groups: a pasteurized milk group and a raw milk group. Each group consisted of breeding pairs. The conclusion of the study measured no significant difference in weights of pasteurized to raw milk consuming mice. Birth weights were measured from each group and showed no significant differences between groups. Overall the study showed no measurable significant difference in nutritional value in growth and fertility of mice.Three studies have found an inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures on the basis of consumption or nonconsumption of raw milk. Aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle have been suggested as having a role in these differences, and for this reason, the overall phenomenon has been named the \"farm effect\". A recent scientific review concluded that \"most studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation of the raw milk's status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.\" For example, in the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma, and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis; \"the effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items themselves or their diversity.\"\n\nLegal status\nRegulation of the commercial distribution of packaged raw milk varies around the world. Some countries have complete bans, but many do not restrict the purchase of raw milk bought directly from the farmer. Raw milk is sometimes distributed through a program, in which the consumer owns a share in the dairy animal or the herd, and therefore can be considered to be consuming milk from their own animal, which is legal. Raw milk is sometimes marketed for animal or pet consumption, or for other uses such as soap making in places where sales for human consumption are prohibited.\n\nAfrica\nAlthough milk consumption in Africa is fairly low compared to the rest of the world, in tribes where milk consumption is popular, such as the Maasai tribe, milk is typically consumed unpasteurized.\n\nAsia\nIn rural areas of Asia where milk consumption is popular, milk is typically unpasteurized. In large cities of Asia, raw milk, especially from water buffalo, is typical. In most countries of Asia, laws prohibiting raw milk are nonexistent or rarely enforced. Milk labelled as \"raw\" (nama) is available in Japan, but the designation means it is 100% raw whole milk before being pasteurized. Unpasteurized milk is very uncommon in Japan. In Singapore, the sale of raw milk for human consumption is prohibited due to safety concerns outlined by the Singapore Food Agency.In India, milk is often drunk raw, although milk supplied in major cities is sometimes pasteurized. Pasteurized or not, milk is often boiled in homes before consumption.\n\nEurope\nIn the European Union it is required that raw milk and products made with raw milk must be labelled to indicate this. Under EU hygiene rules, member states can prohibit or restrict the placing on the market of raw milk intended for human consumption. Individual member states are also free to implement their own stricter requirements. Usually special sanitary regulations and frequent quality tests (at least once per month) are mandatory.\n\nFrance\nRaw milk cheeses make up about 18 per cent of France's total cheese production, and are considered far superior to cheeses made from pasteurised milk. Many French cuisine traditionalists consider pasteurized cheeses almost a sacrilege. Many traditional French cheeses have solely been made from raw milk for hundreds of years. Unpasteurised cheese in France is the major source of staphylococcal food poisoning.\n\nGermany\nIn Germany, packaged raw milk may be sold in shops under the name Vorzugsmilch. The raw milk has to be packed before vending, with the necessary information (producer, shelf life, and special warnings) written on the product. The distribution license has stringent quality restrictions; as of 2012, just 80 farmers in Germany had a license.Unpackaged raw milk may only be sold under specific conditions. It must:\n\nonly be sold at the farm where it was produced\nbe from the day of or the day before production\nhave a warning label \"Raw Milk \u2013 boil before use\"Packed raw milk is sold widely in all health food stores, large supermarkets, gourmet delis and delicatessen sections of department stores. Raw milk is legally sold in the entire country, and the same goes for raw milk cheeses, which are especially sought out and promoted by the health food and slow food movements.\n\nIreland\nIn the Republic of Ireland, raw milk is legal and its sale and production is regulated by the Department of Agriculture. While raw milk was previously banned in Irish law, since 2015, raw milk production has been regulated in accordance with the European Communities (Food and Feed Hygiene) Regulations (2009). Farmers wishing to produce more than 30 litres (6.6 imp gal; 7.9 US gal) of raw milk for human consumption are required to register with the department's Milk Hygiene Division and consent to random sampling of their products as well as regular inspections of their production facilities. The sale and consumption of raw milk has been discouraged by various food safety experts, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.\n\nNordic states\nShops are not permitted to sell unpasteurised milk to consumers in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. All four countries allow limited \"barn door\" sales subject to strict controls. As of 2015, just one distributor in Denmark is licensed to supply restaurants with raw milk from approved farms. Pasteurisation of milk became common practice in Denmark and Sweden in the mid-1880s.\n\nSlovenia\nRaw milk has been available from refrigerated milk vending machines (mlekomati) all over the country since 2010. The milk sold in the machines is subject to stringent regular control.\nAs of 2018, raw milk is also available in shops. The Slovenian National Institute of Public Health advises that consumption of fresh milk from a milk machine that is not heat-treated (boiled) can pose a risk to health.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nAbout 150 producers of raw milk are listed with the Food Standards Agency in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They sell raw, or \"green top\" milk directly to consumers either at the farm, at a farmers' market, or through a delivery service, as it is legal to supply unpasteurised raw milk directly to consumers, but illegal to be sold to a shop. The bottle must display the warning \"this product has not been heat-treated and may contain organisms harmful to health\", and the milk must conform to higher hygiene standards than dairies producing only pasteurised milk.It is an offence to place raw milk or cream on the market for direct consumption in Scotland, following a spate of deaths in 1983.\n\nNorth America\nCanada\nThe sale of raw milk directly to consumers has been prohibited in Canada under the Food and Drug Regulations since 1991.\n\nNo person shall sell the normal lacteal secretion obtained from the mammary gland of the cow, genus Bos, or of any other animal, or sell a dairy product made with any such secretion, unless the secretion or dairy product has been pasteurized by being held at a temperature and for a period that ensure the reduction of the alkaline phosphatase activity so as to meet the tolerances specified in official method MFO-3, Determination of Phosphatase Activity in Dairy Products, dated November 30, 1981.\nProvincial laws also forbid the sale and distribution of raw milk. For instance, Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act, subsection 18(1) reads: \"No person shall sell, offer for sale, deliver or distribute milk or cream that has not been pasteurized or sterilized in a plant that is licensed under the Milk Act or in a plant outside Ontario that meets the standards for plants licensed under the Milk Act.\"\nIn January 2010, Michael Schmidt was found not guilty on 19 charges relating to the sale of raw milk in the Ontario Court of Justice. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, that decision was overturned. Schmidt was convicted on thirteen counts and imposed fines totaling $9,150 and one year of probation. A subsequent appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed.In British Columbia, Alice Jongerden, Michael Schmidt and Gordon Watson\u2014persons involved in the operation of her raw milk dairy\u2014attempted to avoid enforcement of a judgement against them under the Public Health Act by challenging the constitutionality of the legislation, which deems raw milk to be a hazardous product, on the grounds that it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This argument, and other defenses invoked by her and defendants in her business, was rejected in 2013 by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which instead found Schmidt and Watson guilty of civil contempt, and sentenced them to a 3-month suspended sentence imprisonment with a probationary period of 1 year during which \"Any repetition of this contempt ... will trigger the imposed sentence imprisonment of 3 months.\" They were also charged special costs.\nMeanwhile, Canada does permit the sale of raw milk cheeses that are aged over 60 days. In 2009, the province of Quebec modified regulations to allow raw milk cheeses aged less than 60 days provided stringent safeguards are met.\n\nUnited States\nIn the early 20th century, many states within the United States allowed the sale of raw milk that was certified by a \"medical milk commission\", effectively allowing an alternative of extra inspection for pasteurization. In the present day, most states impose restrictions on raw milk suppliers due to concerns about safety. 43 U.S. states allow the sale of raw milk. Cow shares can be found, and raw milk purchased for animal consumption in many states where retail for human consumption is prohibited. The sale of raw milk cheese is permitted as long as the cheese has been aged for 60 days or more.The FDA reports that, in 2002, consuming partially heated raw milk and raw milk products caused 200 Americans to become ill in some manner.Many governmental officials and the majority of public health organizations hold to the need for pasteurization. Before pasteurization, many dairies, especially in cities, fed their cattle on low-quality feed, resulting in the production of milk rife with dangerous bacteria. Pasteurizing it was the only way to make it safely drinkable. The Cornell University Food Science Department has compiled data indicating that pathogenic microorganisms are present in between 0.87% and 12.6% of raw milk samples.Proponents also invoke the benefits of direct-marketing when promoting the sale of raw milk. The ability of the farmer to eliminate the middle-man and sell directly to the consumer allows for greater profitability. Many manufacturers sell small-scale pasteurization equipment, thereby allowing farmers to both bypass the milk processors and sell pasteurized milk directly to the consumer. Additionally, some small U.S. dairies are now beginning to adopt low-temperature vat pasteurization. Advocates of low-temperature vat pasteurization note that it produces a product similar to raw milk in composition.\nFood freedom advocates cite libertarian arguments in claiming a basic civil right of each person to weigh the risks and benefits in choosing the food one eats, including the choice to consume raw milk.\n\nOceania\nAustralia\nThe sale of raw milk for drinking purposes is illegal in all states and territories in Australia, as is all raw milk cheese. This has been circumvented somewhat by selling raw milk as bath milk. An exception to the cheese rule has been made recently for two Roquefort cheeses. There is some indication of share owning cows, allowing the \"owners\" to consume the raw milk, but also evidence that the government is trying to close this loophole.On 8 November 2015, four-year-old Apu Khangura died of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and seven other children became seriously ill, following the consumption of raw milk. In response, the Victorian government created new regulations which require producers to treat raw milk to reduce pathogens, or to make the product unpalatable to taste, such as making it bitter.\n\nNew Zealand\nRaw milk for drinking and raw milk products can be made and sold in New Zealand, but are highly regulated to offset the pathogen risk. Producers of raw milk for sale to consumers must be registered. Raw milk must either be collected by the purchaser from the producer's farm or delivered to the purchaser's home.\n\nSee also\nGut flora\nMedical ethics\nHygiene hypothesis\nRaw foodism\nInfant food safety\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNew York Times: Should This Milk Be Legal?\nCDC: Health Risks are Still Black and White\nRisk of Consumption of Raw Milk Florida Department of Health\nFDA: Raw Milk Q & A\nFDA: The Dangers of Raw Milk\nDunning, Brian (October 8, 2013). \"Skeptoid #383: 5 False Arguments for Raw Milk\".

        "body": "A salted duck egg is an East Asian preserved food product made by soaking duck eggs in brine or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian supermarkets across the Western world, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, and vacuum-packed. From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white, and a firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red.\nSalted duck eggs are normally boiled or steamed before being peeled and eaten as a condiment to congee or cooked with other foods as a flavoring. The texture is gelatin-like egg white and firm and has a perfect round yolk. The egg white has a sharp, salty taste. The orange-red yolk is rich, fatty, and less salty. The yolk is prized and is used in Chinese mooncakes to symbolize the moon.\nSalted eggs can also be made from chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the egg yolk will be less rich.\nSalted eggs sold in the Philippines undergo a similar curing process, with some variation in ingredients used. They are dyed red (hence called itlog na pula or \u2018red eggs' in English) to distinguish them from fresh duck eggs.\n\nProduction\nPateros method\nA popular method for processing salted eggs in the Philippines is the Pateros method. The salted egg is prepared \"Pateros style\" by mixing clay (from ant hills or termite mounds), table salt, and water in a ratio of 1:1:2 until the mixture becomes smooth and forms a thick texture similar to the cake batter. The fresh, uncooked eggs are individually dipped in the admixture, and packed in 150-egg batches in newspaper-lined 250 mm \u00d7 300 mm \u00d7 460 mm (10 in \u00d7 12 in \u00d7 18 in) wooden boxes (often residual boxes of dried fish packing). The whole batch is then lightly wrapped in newspapers to slow down the dehydration process.\nThe eggs are then stored indoors at room temperature over the next 12 to 14 days to cure, the salt equilibrating in the batch by osmosis. Curing can last up to 18 days, but that results in very long-lasting red eggs that can have a 40-day shelf life, which is largely unnecessary, as the eggs are stocked and replenished biweekly.\nAfter the two-week curing period, the eggs are hand-cleaned with water and a brush and prepared to be boiled in low heat for 30 minutes. Time is measured from the first moment the water boils and the eggs are immersed. A 50-egg batch is then wrapped in fish nets for ease of removal from the cookware, which must be large enough to accommodate the batch with a 50 mm (2 in) covering of water.\nChicken eggs may be processed the same way, although up to 10% of the batch can break during the process.\n\nSee also\nBalut\nCentury egg\nChinese red eggs\nList of egg dishes\nSmoked egg\nTea egg\n\nReferences\n\nSandra Leong, 2008.

In this Japanese culinary technique, the most popular sea animal used is fish, but octopus, shrimp, and lobster may also be used. The practice is controversial owing to concerns about the animal's suffering, as it is still alive when served.\n\nPreparation and serving\nThe restaurant may have one or several tanks of live sea animals for a customer to choose from. There are different styles in which a chef may serve the dish but the most common way is to serve it on a plate with the filleted meat assembled on top of the body.\nIkizukiri may be prepared with only three knife cuts by the chef. They are usually presented with the head still whole so that customers are able to see the continuing gill movements.\n\nLegality\nIkizukuri is outlawed in Australia and Germany.

Namer\u014d is grilled directly on an iron griddle, stuffed into scallop or abalone shells or wrapped in sarutoriibara or camellia leaves. Like namer\u014d, it is said to have originated in the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula, and there are places specializing in sangayaki.There are three theories about the original kanji spelling and origin story of the name, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has adopted the first one (\u5c71\u5bb6\u713c\u304d) shown here:\n\u5c71\u5bb6\u713c\u304d spelling: Namer\u014d was grilled or steamed by fishermen in the mountain huts and was eaten, so it was called 'mountain' (\u5c71) and 'house' (\u5bb6) 'fry' (\u713c\u304d).\n\u5c71\u6cb3\u713c\u304d spelling: The spelling of \"Sangayaki\" derived from using both ingredients from the mountains (\u5c71) and rivers (\u6cb3).\n\u4e09\u8f9b\u713c\u304d spelling: The spelling derived from the use of three (\u4e09) spicy (\u8f9b) foods: ginger, green onion, and perilla.\n\nOthers\nA cold dish made by putting namer\u014d in ice water is called mizunamasu (\u6c34\u306a\u307e\u3059).\nNamer\u014d placed on top of rice, with green tea is poured over it to make chazuke, is called magocha (\u5b6b\u8336). Magocha is a local dish of the coastal area of the Izu Peninsula, where it is not seared but is served with dashi stock on the sashimi. In addition to horse mackerel, sashimi can be made from tuna, bonito, and alfonsino, depending on the location and restaurant.\nAround Isumi District, Chiba Prefecture, namer\u014d is placed on a slightly deep plate, flattened, sanbaizu (vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar in 1:1:1 proportions) is added, and chilled in a refrigerator. This is aimed at the effect of preserving namer\u014d, which is easily spoiled in the summer and cannot be stored in advance, and stimulating appetite decreased in the summer with acid. Depending on the family, this is eaten with soy sauce or another dipping sauce.\nIn Shimanoura, a remote island off the coast of Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, there is a dish called tatakko (\u305f\u305f\u3063\u3053), which is similar to namer\u014d, and the grilled dish corresponding to sanga in the Boso Peninsula is also called 'tatakko'.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Tongan, Tahitian, and Samoan variants are essentially identical in that the raw fish is briefly marinated in lemon or lime juice until the surface of the flesh becomes opaque. The fish is then mixed with coconut milk and diced vegetables (most commonly cucumber, tomato, onion, green onion, and spicy peppers). This is the national dish of Tonga.\n\nNames\nCook Islands: ika mata\nFiji: kokoda\nFrench Polynesia: poisson cru, i\u02bba ota\nNauru: coconut fish\nNiue: \u02bbota \u02bbika\nSamoa: oka i\u02bba\nTokelau: \u02bbota \u02bbika\nTonga: \u02bbota \u02bbika\nTuvalu: ika mata\nWallis and Futuna: ika otaThe dish is otherwise known as coconut fish in Nauru, kokoda in Fiji and Papua New Guinea, oka in Samoa, ika mata in the Cook Islands and New Zealand, oraora in Kiribati, and simply poisson cru on the French islands. The word \"ota\" means \"raw\" within the Polynesian language group, although the more common term for the dish in French Polynesia is its French equivalent, \"poisson cru\" (literally, \"raw fish\"). Any type of seafood can be used to make \"ota,\" the word \"ika\" means fish (\"i'a\" in Samoan language), but the dish is often prepared with mussels (\"ota pipi/maso\"), prawns (\"ota ulavai\"), crab (\"ota pa'a/paka\"), lobster (\"ota ula\"), octopus/squid (\"ota fe'e/feke\"), sea urchin (\"ota vana/tuitui\"), and eel (\"ota pusi\").\n\nGallery\nVariants\n\nSimilar dishes\nA very similar dish are the kinilaw and ata-ata of the Philippines, and its descendant dish, the kelaguen of the Marianas Islands. The poke and lomi salmon of Hawaii are also similar.

        "body": "Stroganina (Russian \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430, literally \"shavings\") is a dish of the northern Russians and indigenous people of northern Arctic Siberia consisting of raw, thin, long-sliced frozen fish. Around Lake Baikal, the dish is referred to as raskolotka. Traditional stroganina is made with freshwater whitefish salmonids found in the Siberian Arctic waters such as nelma, muksun, chir, and omul. Rarely, it is made with sturgeon. This dish is popular with native Siberians, and is present in Yakutian cuisine, Eskimo cuisine, Komi cuisine and Yamal cuisine. It is often paired with vodka.\n\nIngredients and preparation\nFrozen fish is used for the preparation of stroganina. The fish for stroganina is usually caught by ice fishing during the late fall and fresh frozen in order to avoid the formation of ice crystals in the meat. Frozen fish can be glazed with near-freezing ice water in order to avoid dehydration and better-preserve the fish meat in a frozen state. The fish is typically frozen straight, without bending its body.\nBefore the preparation of stroganina, strips of skin are cut from the back and abdomen from tail to head. Vertical incisions are made in the flesh. The fish is placed head down on a hard surface and skinned. Thin slices of fish fillet cut along the body using a sharp knife. The geometry of the Yakutian knife is best suited to cut long slices that will form ribbon curls. In order to keep the slices frozen as long as possible, the stroganina is served immediately on non-metallic frozen plates or in ice-cold bowls with salt and black pepper powder. It is usually eaten with the hands while still frozen.\nStroganina, like caviar, is often consumed with vodka.\n\nVariations\nA variation of the dish is molochnaya stroganina, which is prepared using stroganina and frozen fresh milk.The name is also applied to stroganina from reindeer meat.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe restaurant \"Stroganina Bar\" in Moscow, Russia, specializes in stroganina.The city of Yakutsk holds festivals celebrating the local delicacy.\n\nSee also\nList of raw fish dishes\nList of Russian dishes\nList of seafood dishes\nRui-be\nSashimi\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Stroganina at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "Omophagia, or omophagy (from Greek \u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \"raw\") is the eating of raw flesh. The term is of importance in the context of the cult worship of Dionysus.\nOmophagia is a large element of Dionysiac myth; in fact, one of Dionysus' epithets is Omophagos \"Raw-Eater\". Omophagia may have been a symbol of the triumph of wild nature over civilization, and a symbol of the breaking down of boundaries between nature and civilization. It might also have been symbolic that the worshippers were internalizing Dionysus' wilder traits and his association with brute nature, in a sort of \"communion\" with the god.Mythology sometimes depicts Maenads, Dionysus' female worshippers, eating raw meat as part of their worship; however, there is little solid \nevidence that historical Maenads consumed raw meat.The Dionysiac diet of raw meat may be more properly attributed to Dionysus himself, rather than his followers\u2014he received sacrifices of raw meat and was believed to consume them, but his followers did not share in the consumption.\n\nOrphism\nThe Orphic mysteries originated as a ritual which focused on purification and the afterlife; the mysteries were based on the stories of Dionysus Zagreus.\nZagreus was the child of Zeus and Persephone, who was torn apart by the Titans in an act of sparagmos. After tearing Zagreus apart, the Titans devoured him, except for his heart.\nHis body was then reassembled; this may be reflected in the story of Pentheus, whose body parts were gathered together after his mother, aunt and other Maenads tore him apart in a Dionysic frenzy, and the story of Actaeon, who was eaten by his own hunting dogs. Because the dogs grieved so deeply after Actaeon's death, an image of him was made to comfort them. All three stories show a common motif of reassembly of body parts following sparagmos and omophagia, and this motif may have been significant for religious ritual.In Orphism, worshippers took part in an Orphic ritual which reenacted the story of Zagreus, using a bull as their victim (poorer worshippers may have used a goat instead).  They considered the ritual to be \"commemorative\" of events in their god's existence. In his article \"A New Ritual of the Orphic Mysteries\", Michael Tierney says that \"... by sacramental re-enactment of the god's death, a hope of salvation for his worshippers was obtained.\"\nDionysus became associated with Zagreus, and the story of having been torn apart and eaten by the Titans was applied to him as well.Omophagia was the focus of the Dionysiac mysteries, and a component of Orphic ceremonies.  In its beginnings, Orphism was influenced by the Eleusinian mysteries, and it adopted stories from other mythologies as its own.  The worshippers of Zagreus may have engaged in omophagia as an initiation rite.\n\nThe Bacchae\nEuripides' play The Bacchae focuses on the worship of Dionysus, including allusions to omophagia and its companion sparagmos (dismemberment). In this play, the character Agave tears her son Pentheus apart while under the influence of Dionysus. Because Euripides depicts Agave as engaging in sparagmos, he likely intended for the audiences to assume she engaged in omophagia as well: additionally, the character Cadmus compares Agave's actions to the story of Actaeon, who was consumed by his own hunting dogs\u2014this association further suggests that omophagia took place.There is another possible instance of omophagia in The Bacchae. At one point in the play, the maenads go into a nearby town and carry off the children; it is possible that the maenads then consumed them. In art and myth, this incident is linked to omophagia; however, Euripides may not have intended this meaning in The Bacchae.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "An ice pop is a liquid/cream-based frozen dessert on a stick. Unlike ice cream or sorbet, which are whipped while freezing to prevent ice crystal formation, an ice pop is frozen while at rest, becoming  a solid block of ice. The stick is used as a handle to hold it. Without a stick, the frozen product would be a freezie.\nAn ice pop is also referred to as a popsicle in Canada and the United States, a paleta in Mexico, the Southwestern United States and parts of Latin America, an ice lolly or lolly ice in the United Kingdom and Ireland, an ice block in New Zealand and Australia, an ice drop in the Philippines, an ice gola in India, ice candy in the Philippines, India and Japan, ai tim tang or ice cream tang in Thailand, and a kisko in the Caribbean. The term icy pole is often used in Australia, but is a brand name.\n\nHistory\nAs far back as 1872, two men, doing business as Ross and Robbins, sold a frozen-fruit confection on a stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey.Francis William \"Frank\" Epperson of Oakland, California, popularized ice pops after patenting the concept of \"frozen ice on a stick\" in 1923.Epperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905, at the age of 11, when he accidentally left a glass of powdered lemonade soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story still printed on the back of Popsicle treat boxes.\nEpperson lived in Oakland and worked as a lemonade salesman.In 1922, Epperson, a realtor with Realty Syndicate Company in Oakland,introduced the Popsicle at a fireman's ball. The product got traction quickly; in 1923, at the age of 29, Epperson received a patent for his \"Epsicle\" ice pop, and by 1924, had patented all handled, frozen confections or ice lollipops. He officially debuted the Epsicle in seven fruit flavors at Neptune Beach amusement park, marketed as a \"frozen lollipop\", or a \"drink on a stick\".A couple of years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City.\n\nTerminology\nIn the United States and Canada, frozen ice on a stick is generically referred to as a popsicle due to the early popularity of the Popsicle brand, and the word has become a genericized trademark to mean any ice pop, regardless of brand or format. The word is a portmanteau of pop and icicle; the word is genericized to such an extent that there are decades-old derived slang meanings such as \"popsicle stand\". The term ice pop is also used in the United States.In Ireland, the term ice pop is predominantly used. In the United Kingdom, the term ice lolly is used to refer to ice pop while the term ice pop refers to a freezie (flavoured ice inside a tube). The term chihiro is used as a slang term in the Cayman Islands, partially derived from chill. Different parts of Australia use either ice block or icy pole (which is a brand name), and New Zealand uses ice block. In the Philippines, the term ice drop is used with coconut flavor ice pops being called ice bukos. India uses the terms ice gola and ice candy. In Japan the term ice candy is used.\n\nPaleta\nAfter a trip to the United States in the early 1940s, Ignacio Alc\u00e1zar returned to his home city of Tocumbo, Michoac\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, bringing the idea to manufacture ice pops or paletas (little sticks) using locally available fresh fruit. He and some family members expanded by opening a shop in Mexico City which became very popular and he began to franchise Paleter\u00eda La Michoacana to friends and family from his town. The popularity of paletas and association with Tocumbo has increased to the status of a national Mexican food.Paleta flavors can be divided into two basic categories: milk-based or water-based. The composition of each flavor may vary, but the base is most often fruit. Paleterias usually have dozens of flavors of paleta including local flavors like horchata, tamarind, mamey and nanche along with other flavors like strawberry, lime, chocolate and mango. Distinctly Mexican ingredients like chili pepper, chamoy, and vanilla are often present in these paletas. Paleterias adapt their flavors to the tastes of the community and local availability of ingredients.\n\nPaletero\nA paletero (roughly equivalent to the English \"ice cream man\"), is a street seller of paletas and other frozen treats, usually from a pushcart labeled with the name of the enterprise that made the paletas (paleter\u00eda). Today, many paleteros are now commonly found in American cities with significant Mexican populations. Vending requirements for paleteros vary widely by city.\n\nHomemade ice pops\nAn alternative to the store-bought ice pops is making them at home using fruit juice, drinks, or any freezable beverage. A classic method involves using ice cube trays and toothpicks, although various ice pop freezer molds are also available.\nIn the UK, there is an increasing number of people making alcoholic ice lollies at home by putting alcoholic drinks inside the mould. Buckfast, Kopparberg and Strongbow Dark Fruit ciders are popular choices used.\n\nInnovations in ice pop creation\nIn 2018, the UK food-focused design firm called Bompas & Parr announced that they had created the world's first 'non-melting' ice pop. The ice pop does melt but not as fast as other ice pops. This is due to the strands of fruit fibers inside the ice pops which makes them thicker than regular ice pops. The thicker the ice pop the slower it melts. This design was inspired by the material called pykrete, which was invented by Geoffrey Pyke.\n\nWorld record ice pop\nOn June 22, 2005, Snapple tried to beat the existing Guinness World Records entry of a 1997 Dutch 21-foot (6.4 m) ice pop by attempting to erect a 25-foot (7.6 m) ice pop in New York City. The 17.5 short tons (15.9 t) of frozen juice that had been brought from Edison, New Jersey, in a freezer truck melted faster than expected, dashing hopes of a new record. Spectators fled to higher ground as firefighters hosed away the melted juice.\n\nSee also\nCreamsicle\nFreezie\u2014a.k.a. ice pole, similar to an ice pop, but without the stick\nIce cream\nIce cream bar\u2014similar to an ice pop, but made with ice cream\nLollipops\nSorbet\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nlaverr\u00e1n, Virginia Gonz\u00e1lez. \"Historia del Helado en M\u00e9xico By Martin Gonz\u00e1lez de la Vara\".

        "body": "Marshmallow (UK: , US: ) is a confectionery made from sugar, water and gelatin whipped to a solid-but-soft consistency. It is used as a filling in baking or  molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. This sugar confection is inspired by a medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marsh-mallow plant.\n\nHistory\nThe word \"marshmallow\" comes from the mallow plant species (Althaea officinalis), a herb native to parts of Europe, North Africa, and Asia which grows in marshes and other damp areas. The plant's stem and leaves are fleshy, and its white flower has five petals. It is not known exactly when marshmallows were invented, but their history goes back as early as 2000 BCE. Ancient Egyptians were said to be the first to make and use the root of the plant to soothe coughs and sore throats and to heal wounds. The first marshmallows were prepared by boiling pieces of root pulp with honey until thick. Once thickened, the mixture was strained, cooled, then used as intended.Whether used for candy or medicine, the manufacture of marshmallows was limited to a small scale. In the early to mid 19th century, the marshmallow had made its way to France, where confectioners augmented the plant's traditional medicinal value with indulgent ingredients utilized by the Egyptians. Owners of small candy stores would whip the sap from the mallow root into a fluffy candy mold. This candy, called P\u00e2te de Guimauve, was a spongy-soft dessert made from whipping dried marshmallow roots with sugar, water, and egg whites. It was sold in bar form as a lozenge. Drying and preparation of the marshmallow took one to two days before the final product was produced. In the late 19th century, candy makers started looking for a new process and discovered the starch mogul system, in which trays of modified corn starch had a mold firmly pushed down in them to create cavities within the starch. The cavities were then filled with the whipped marshmallow sap mixture and allowed to cool or harden. At the same time, candy makers began to replace the mallow root with gelatin which created a stable form of marshmallow.By the early 20th century, thanks to the starch mogul system, marshmallows were introduced to the United States and available for mass consumption. They were sold in tins as penny candy and were soon used in a variety of food recipes like banana fluff, lime mallow sponge, and tutti frutti. In 1956, Alex Doumak patented the extrusion process which involved running marshmallow ingredients through tubes. The tubes created a long rope of marshmallow mixture and were then set out to cool. The ingredients were then cut into equal pieces and packaged.Modern marshmallow manufacturing is highly automated and has been since the early 1950s when the extrusion process was first developed. Numerous improvements and advancements allow for the production of thousands of pounds of marshmallow a day. Today, the marshmallow typically consists of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent.\n\nIngredients\nMarshmallows consist of four ingredients: sugar, water, air, and a whipping agent/aerator (usually a protein). The type of sugar and whipping agent varies depending on desired characteristics.  Each ingredient plays a specific role in the final product.\nThe marshmallow is a foam, consisting of an aqueous continuous phase and a gaseous dispersed phase (in other words, a liquid with gas bubbles spread throughout). In addition to being a foam, this also makes marshmallows an \"aerated\" confection because it is made up of 50% air. The goal of an aerated confection like a marshmallow is to incorporate gas into a sugar mixture, and stabilize the aerated product before the gas can escape. When the gas is introduced into the system, tiny air bubbles are created. This is what contributes to the unique textural properties and mouth-feel of this product.\n\nProtein\nIn marshmallows, proteins are the main surface-active agents responsible for the formation, and stabilization of the dispersed air.  Due to their structure, surface-active molecules gather at the surface area of a portion of (water-based) liquid. A portion of each protein molecule is hydrophilic, with a polar charge, and another portion is hydrophobic and non-polar. The non-polar section has little or no affinity for water, and so this section orients as far away from the water as possible. However, the polar section is attracted to the water and has little or no affinity for the air. Therefore, the molecule orients with the polar section in the water, with the non-polar section in the air. Two primary proteins that are commonly used as aerators in marshmallows are albumen (egg whites) and gelatin.\n\nAlbumen (egg whites)\nAlbumen is a mixture of proteins found in egg whites and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to fresh egg whites. In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. Fresh egg whites carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, fresh egg whites are usually used. Albumen is rarely used on its own when incorporated into modern marshmallows, and instead is used in conjunction with gelatin.\n\nGelatin\nGelatin is the aerator most often used in the production of marshmallows. It is made up of collagen, a structural protein derived from animal skin, connective tissue, and bones. Not only can it stabilize foams, like albumen, but when combined with water it forms a thermally-reversible gel. This means that gelatin can melt, then reset due to its sensitivity to temperature. The melting point of gelatin gel is around 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C), which is just below normal body temperature (around 97 \u00b0F (36 \u00b0C)). This is what contributes to the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" sensation when a marshmallow is consumed\u2014it actually starts to melt when it touches the tongue.During preparation, the temperature needs to be just above the melting point of the gelatin, so that as soon as it is formed it cools quickly, and the gelatin will set, retaining the desired shape. If the marshmallow rope mixture exiting the extruder during processing is too warm, the marshmallow starts to flow before the gelatin sets. Instead of a round marshmallow, it will take a more oval form. Excessive heat can also degrade, or break down, the gelatin itself. Therefore, when marshmallows are being produced at home or by artisan candy makers, the gelatin is added after the syrup has been heated and cooled down.\nIn commercial operations, the gelatin is simply cooked with the sugar syrup, rather than being added later after the syrup has cooled. In this case, kinetics play an important role, with both time and temperature factoring in. If the gelatin was added at the beginning of a batch that was then cooked to 112\u2013116 \u00b0C in 20\u201330 minutes, a significant amount of gelatin would break down. The marshmallow would have reduced springiness from that loss of gelatin. But since the time the syrup spends at elevated temperature in modern cookers is so short, there is little to no degradation of the gelatin.In terms of texture, and mouth-feel, gelatin makes marshmallows chewy by forming a tangled 3-D network of polymer chains.  Once gelatin is dissolved in warm water (dubbed the \"blooming stage\"), it forms a dispersion, which results in a cross-linking of its helix-shaped chains.  The linkages in the gelatin protein network trap air in the marshmallow mixture and immobilize the water molecules in the network. The result is the well-known spongy structure of marshmallows. This is why the omission of gelatin from a marshmallow recipe will result in marshmallow creme, since there is no gelatin network to trap the water and air bubbles.\n\nSugars\nA traditional marshmallow might contain about 60% corn syrup, 30% sugar, and 1\u20132% gelatin. A combination of different sugars is used to control the solubility of the solution. The corn syrup/sugar ratio will influence the texture by slowing crystallization of the sucrose. The smooth texture of marshmallows relies on disordered, or amorphous, sugar molecules. In contrast, increasing the sugar ratio to about 60\u201365% will produce a grainy marshmallow. Temperature also plays an important role in producing smooth marshmallows by reducing the time window for ordered crystals to form. To ensure the sugars are disordered, the sugar syrup solution is heated to a high temperature and then cooled rapidly.\n\nSugarcane and sugar beet\nSugarcane and sugar beet are the two primary sources of sugar, consisting of sucrose molecules. Sucrose is a disaccharide that consists of one glucose and fructose molecule. This sugar provides sweetness and bulk to the marshmallow, while simultaneously setting the foam to a firm consistency as it cools. Sucrose, and sugars in general, impair the ability of a foam to form, but improve foam stability. Therefore, sucrose is used in conjunction with a protein like gelatin. The protein can adsorb, unfold, and form a stable network, while the sugar can increase the viscosity. Liquid drainage of the continuous phase must be minimized as well. Thick liquids drain more slowly than thin ones, and so increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase will reduce drainage. A high viscosity is essential if a stable foam is to be produced. Therefore, sucrose is a main component of marshmallow. But sucrose is seldom used on its own, because of its tendency to crystallize.\n\nCorn syrup\nCorn syrup, derived from maize, contains glucose, maltose, and other oligosaccharides. Corn syrup can be obtained from the partial hydrolysis of cornstarch. Corn syrup is important in the production of marshmallow because it prevents the crystallization of other sugars (like sucrose). It may also contribute body, reduce sweetness, and alter flavor release, depending on the Dextrose Equivalent (DE) of the glucose syrup used.\nThe DE is the measure of the amount of reducing sugars present in a sugar product in relation to glucose. Lower-DE glucose syrups will provide a chewier texture, while higher-DE syrups will make the product more tender. In addition, depending on the type of DE used, can alter the sweetness, hygroscopicity, and browning of the marshmallow. Corn syrup is flavorless and cheap to produce which is why candy companies love using this product.\n\nInvert sugar\nInvert sugar is produced when sucrose breaks down due to the addition of water, also known as hydrolysis. This molecule exhibits all the characteristics of honey except the flavor because it is the primary sugar found in honey. This means that invert sugar has the ability to prevent crystallization, and produce a tender marshmallow. It is also an effective humectant, which allows it to trap water, and prevent the marshmallow from drying out. For some candies, this is not a good trait to have, but for marshmallows, it is an advantage since it has a high moisture content.\n\nFruit syrups\nWhile not widely used for traditional or commercial recipes, fruit syrups have been proposed as an alternative sugar for marshmallows.\n\nAdditional ingredients\nFlavors\nUnless a variation of the standard marshmallow is being made, vanilla is always used as the flavoring. The vanilla can either be added in extract form, or by infusing the vanilla beans in the sugar syrup during cooking. This is the best technique to get an even distribution of flavor throughout the marshmallow.\n\nAcids\nAcids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, may also be used to increase foam stability. Addition of acid decreases the pH. This reduces the charge on the protein molecules, and brings them closer to their isoelectric point. This results in a stronger, more stable inter-facial film. When added to egg whites, acid prevents excessive aggregation at the interface. However, acid delays foam formation. It may therefore be added toward the end of the whipping process after a stable foam has been created.\n\nManufacturing process\nCommercial process\nIn commercial marshmallow manufacture, the entire process is streamlined and fully automated.\nGelatin is cooked with sugar and syrup. After the gelatin-containing syrup is cooked, it is allowed to cool slightly before air is incorporated. Whipping is generally accomplished in a rotor-stator type device. Compressed air is injected into the warm syrup, held at a temperature just above the melting point of gelatin. In a marshmallow aerator, pins on a rotating cylinder (rotor) intermesh with stationary pins on the wall (stator) provide the shear forces necessary to break the large injected air bubbles into numerous tiny bubbles that provide the smooth, fine-grained texture of the marshmallow. A continuous stream of light, fluffy marshmallow exits the aerator en route to the forming step.\nThe marshmallow confection is typically formed in one of three ways. First, it can be extruded in the desired shape and cut into pieces, as done for Jet-Puffed marshmallows. Second, it can be deposited onto a belt, as done for Peeps. Third, it can be deposited into a starch-based mold in a mogul to make various shapes.\n\nHome making process\nThe home process for making marshmallow differs from commercial processes. A mixture of corn syrup and sugar is boiled to about 252 \u00b0F (122 \u00b0C). In a separate step, gelatin is hydrated with enough warm water to make a thick solution. Once the sugar syrup has cooled to about 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), the gelatin solution is blended in along with desired flavoring, and whipped in a mixer to reach the final density. The marshmallow is then scooped out of the bowl, slabbed on a table, and cut into pieces.\n\nRoasted marshmallows and s'mores\nA popular camping or backyard tradition in the United Kingdom, North America,  New Zealand and Australia is the roasting or toasting of marshmallows over a campfire or other open flame. A marshmallow is placed on the end of a stick or skewer and held carefully over the fire.  This creates a caramelized outer skin with a liquid, molten layer underneath. Major flavor compounds and color polymers associated with sugar browning are created during the caramelization process.S'mores are a traditional campfire treat in the United States, made by placing a toasted marshmallow on a slab of chocolate, which is placed between two graham crackers. These can then be squeezed together, causing the chocolate to begin melting.\n\nNutrition\nMarshmallows are defined in US law as a food of minimal nutritional value.\n\nDietary preferences\nThe traditional marshmallow recipe uses powdered marshmallow root, but most commercially manufactured marshmallows instead use gelatin in their manufacture. Vegans and vegetarians avoid gelatin, but there are versions which use a substitute non-animal gelling agent such as agar. In addition, marshmallows are generally not considered to be kosher or halal unless either their gelatin is derived from kosher or halal animals or they are vegan.Marshmallow creme and other less firm marshmallow products generally contain little or no gelatin, which mainly serves to allow the familiar marshmallow confection to retain its shape. They generally use egg whites instead. Non-gelatin, egg-containing versions of this product may be consumed by ovo vegetarians. Several brands of vegetarian and vegan marshmallows and marshmallow fluff exist.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Marshmallow Explained at HowStuffWorks.com",

'sugar calabash'), also called bingtang hulu (\u51b0\u7cd6\u846b\u82a6; \u51b0\u7cd6\u846b\u8606; b\u012bngt\u00e1ng h\u00falu; 'rock-sugar calabash'), is a traditional Chinese snack consisting of several rock sugar-coated fruits of Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifida) on a bamboo skewer. It is named for its calabash-like shape. Tanghulu is called Tang dun er (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u58a9\u513f) in Tianjin, Tang qiu (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u7403) in Fengyang, Anhui, Tang zhan er (simplified Chinese: \u7cd6\u8638\u513f) in Shandong. Tanghulu is often mistaken for regular candied fruits; however, it is coated in a hardened sugar syrup. This sweet and sour treat has been made since the Song Dynasty, and it remains popular throughout northern China.Chinese hawthorn is the traditional fruit used for the skewering of fruit, but in ancient times, vendors have also used various other fruits.For example, in records from the Qing Dynasty, grapes and walnuts were added.(\u300a\u71d5\u4eac\u5c81\u65f6\u8bb0\u300b\uff1a\u51b0\u7cd6\u846b\u82a6\uff0c\u4e43\u7528\u7af9\u7b7e\uff0c\u8d2f\u4ee5\u5c71\u91cc\u7ea2\u3001\u6d77\u68e0\u679c\u3001\u8461\u8404\u3001\u9ebb\u5c71\u836f\u3001\u6838\u6843\u4ec1\u3001\u8c46\u6c99\u7b49\uff0c\u8638\u4ee5\u51b0\u7cd6\uff0c\u751c\u8106\u800c\u51c9\u3002) In modern times, fruit choices have become more diverse, such as cherry tomatoes, mandarin oranges, strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, kiwifruit, or bananas. The pits and seeds of the hawthorn are emptied out and are commonly filled with sweet red bean paste before being skewered and dipped.\n\nOrigin\nTraditionally a Northern Chinese dessert, especially famous in Beijing in numerous Qing dynasty accounts. Earlier legends may be traced back to the Southern Song Dynasty, when the emperor Song Guangzong (simplified Chinese: \u5b8b\u5149\u5b97) had a very beloved Imperial concubine named Huang Guifei. One day, when Huang was sick, she refused to eat or drink all day long, and she seemed about to die at any moment. Palace doctors were puzzled as to how to cure her, resulting in Song Guangzong spending an exorbitant amount of money seeking medical help. Later, a doctor came to the palace and treated Huang. He ordered cooks to prepare the hawthorn with rock sugar, advising Huang to take five to ten of them before each meal. Surprisingly, after a few days, Huang gradually recovered. Everyone thought this method was quite novel, so the prescription was passed down. Later, people began to string the fruit together and sell it on the street, which is now known as tanghulu.\n\nNutrition\nTanghulu is rich in Vitamin C, pectin and chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, maslinic acid, oleanolic acid, quercetin, ursolic acid, chrysin, epicatechin and other organic acids and nutritional elements. The Chinese Hawthorn may have medicinal effects, such as reducing the effects of constipation and dysentery and lowering blood lipids and cholesterol, and its medicinal properties have been widely asserted in Chinese Medicine books. However, due to its high sugar content, long-term consumption may be unsuitable for diabetics or people with other health conditions.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nCandy apple\nRock candy\nLigao Tang\nList of Chinese desserts\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Tanghulu at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "Pollo a la brasa, pollo asado, blackened chicken, or charcoal chicken is a variety of rotisserie chicken especially associated with the cuisine of Peru.It was developed in Peru in the 1950s by Swiss immigrants to Peru.Originally its consumption was specific to high-end restaurants (during the 1950s until the 1970s), but today it is a widely available dish. The original version consisted of a chicken (cooked on a spit over charcoal and seasoned only with salt) served with large french fries and traditionally eaten with the fingers, though today additional spices are used to prepare it, and people may eat it with cutlery if they choose.  It is almost always served with creamy (mayonnaise-based) sauces, and most frequently with a salsa known as aj\u00ed.  \nIn 2013, Peruvian cuisine was listed among the top three cuisines with potential for popular menu items in the United States. Pollo a la brasa can now be found in eateries all throughout the world and is considered to be a staple item on the menu of Peruvian fusion restaurants.  It is considered a national dish of Peru; with Peruvians consuming it an average of three times per month and with rotisserie chicken restaurants accounting for 40% of the fast food industry in the country.\n\nHistory\nThe dish was developed by Roger Schuler, a Swiss resident of Chaclacayo, Lima, in 1950.  Schuler was a Swiss national who found it difficult to return to his home country during World War II, and after migrating around several locations in Chile and Peru, settled in Lima, working in hotels and restaurants.  He devised the specific method of cooking the chicken, observing his cook's technique in preparation, and gradually, along with his business partners, perfected the recipe, creating the Granja Azul restaurant in Santa Clara, district of Ate, in Lima.  After developing the initial recipe, he received a large catering order, and seeking to cook a larger volume of food in a shorter time, sought out a fellow Swiss immigrant, Franz Ulrich, a metalworker who developed a type of rotisserie oven to allow high throughput of chicken he named \"El rotombo\".  While the initial preparation only included salt as a seasoning, today preparations typically include rosemary, huacatay, black pepper, soy sauce, aj\u00ed panca, and cumin.  The Schuler family still owns the Granja Azul, and a number of other restaurants around Peru, and Ulrich continued to produce rotisserie ovens.\n\nSee also\nPeruvian cuisine\nList of chicken dishes\nList of spit-roasted foods\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Grodziskie (Polish pronunciation: [\u0261r\u0254\u02c8d\u0361\u0291isk\u02b2\u025b]; other names: Gr\u00e4tzer, Grodzisz) is a historical beer style from Poland made from oak-smoked wheat malt with a clear, light golden color, high carbonation, low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma.  The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment it. It was nicknamed \"Polish Champagne\" because of its high carbonation levels and valued as a high-quality beer for special occasions.\nGrodziskie is brewed from wheat malt that has been dried by circulating oak smoke through the grains.  The smokiness of the grain and the mineral profile of the water used to brew the beverage gives the style its characteristic flavor.   Polish breweries historically used locally grown hops and one or two strains of brewer's yeast in its production.   Before packaging, the beer is treated with isinglass to produce a bright, clear appearance.  The beer is packaged before all of the fermentable sugars have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers.  Fermentation continues after packaging, and the carbon dioxide that is produced remains dissolved in the beer, resulting in a very high level of carbonation in the final product.\nThe beer was originally produced by brewers in the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski in the 14th or 15th century.  Strict regulations regarding the quality of the beer were established by the local brewers' guild, and helped it develop a good reputation in the surrounding cities and neighboring countries.  At the peak of its fame, it was exported to 37 countries and was regarded as an exceptionally good beer.  The brewing industry in the town flourished.   After the Second World War, beer production was nationalized, and the beer entered a period of decline under the Communist government of Poland.  By 1993, the last brewery that was producing the style was shut down.  After a period of years when the style was not available from any commercial brewers, several breweries began producing seasonal or year-round recreations of the historic style, spurred by interest in the style from the homebrewing community around the world.\n\nDescription\nGrodziskie is a highly carbonated, low-alcohol beer with a clear, pale yellow to golden color, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a moderate to medium-high smoky aroma and flavor.  The bright, clear, and highly carbonated appearance of Grodziskie has caused the beer to be compared with Champagne, and it is sometimes referred to as \"Polish Champagne\". Most beers that are made from wheat appear cloudy, because the final product contains suspended yeast and proteins from the wheat.   During the production of Grodziskie, however, the beer is filtered before it is bottled, usually by adding isinglass.  The filtration removes the suspended yeast and proteins, leaving a bright, clear beer.  When poured into a glass, it produces a large, long-lasting, tight head with small bubbles.  It was traditionally served in tall, conical glasses that were designed to show off the clear, golden color, as well allow a wide, thick layer of foam to form when it was poured.The taste is light and crisp, with some bite from the carbonation.  Brewing and tasting notes from a 1914 publication described Grodziskie as a \"rough, bitter beer ... with an intense smoke and hop flavor\", but by the late 20th century, the style's flavor had likely evolved to include less hop flavor and bitterness.  Modern recreations of this style tend to focus on smoky flavor resulting from the oak-smoked malt, described as \"somewhat acrid to semi-sweet\", but literature from the 1960s states that a significant proportion of the beer's unique flavors are produced by its malting and brewing process and special strains of brewer's yeast that were used in its production.  The flavor may also contain a mild wheat graininess noticeable in the background.Historically, Grodziskie was made with alcohol levels of around 3.1% abv, but commercial versions were also made with alcohol levels ranging from 2.5% to 5% abv.\n\nIngredients\nThe grain used in Grodziskie is malted wheat.   During the malting process, the wheat is dried in kilns that are heated by oak-burning furnaces.   Instead of using the furnaces to heat clean air which is then used to dry the wheat, the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed.  The smoke dries the grain, and imparts a light color and an intense, pleasant, smoky flavor.  This  process would not be possible in the type of kilns that were more common in the past, that burned coal or coke as fuel because the soot in the smoke would cause the grain to become discolored and contribute undesirable harsh flavors.   The exact degree of smokiness that resulted from the oak kilning in historical times is not known.  The smoke from the malting process also adds chemical components to the finished product that help preserve it, giving it a long shelf life despite its low alcohol content.  One story is told of a box of Grodziskie being found in the 1950s, buried in the sands of North Africa, that was left behind by German soldiers during World War II.  The beer was opened and found to be as fresh as the day it was made.   In addition to wheat, there were periods when the beer also included malted barley in various proportions, but for most of its history, it was made entirely from wheat.Many of the flavor characteristics of Grodziskie result from the chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer.   The water from one of the wells on Pozna\u0144ska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm.Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm.   Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions.   During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to fermentable sugars during mashing.  The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content.   Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.Two unique strains of yeast were traditionally used; one highly flocculent strain that was responsible for most of the fermentation in the first few days, and the other, a powdery and less flocculant strain, that was slower and finished off the beer in the fermentation vats and in the bottles.  Until the end of the 19th century, the breweries that produced Grodziskie used a single strain of yeast that was characterized by low attenuation and early flocculation.  However, that strain was lost in the early 20th century.  After World War II, yeast was imported from the Groterjan Brewery in Berlin. That  yeast was not well suited for producing Grodziskie and was frequently contaminated with spoilage organisms including Lactobacillus.  In the 1960s, the state-owned brewery was able to isolate and maintain suitable strains of yeast that produced the desired characteristics, but only the highly-flocculant strain has been preserved to this day.  Without access to the actual yeast used historically, most modern recreations of Grodziskie typically use ale yeasts that do not contribute a significant amount of yeast character to the beer.Brewers typically used locally produced varieties of Polish hops such as Nowotomyski, but would occasionally substitute similar noble hops.  Historical sources indicate that around the end of the 19th century, breweries used 3 kilograms (6.6 lb) of hops for every 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wheat malt, but by the 1960s the hopping rate had decreased to 2.4 kilograms (5.3 lb) of hops per 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wheat malt.\n\nProduction\nThe beer was variously produced using an infusion mash or a decoction mash.  Some of the traditional production methods of the style are known from undated records from the Grodzisk brewery.    These records describe an infusion mash that included a 30-minute acid rest at 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F), a 30 to 60 minute protease rest at 52 \u00b0C (126 \u00b0F), an \u03b1-amylase rest for 30 minutes at 70 \u00b0C (158 \u00b0F), and a mash out at 75 \u00b0C (167 \u00b0F).   The wort was boiled for 90 to 120 minutes.  Approximately 80% of the hops were added after 15 minutes and the remaining 20% were added 30 minutes before the end of the boil.After the boil, the wort was cooled and fermented in open wooden vats at 14\u201316 \u00b0C (57\u201361 \u00b0F).  The two strains of yeast were added at the same time, and fermentation would proceed rapidly.  After one day of fermentation, the thick foam that formed on the top of the fermentation vat was skimmed off and discarded. After 60 hours, up to 50% of the available sugars would have been fermented by the yeast, and thick clumps of yeast were skimmed off of the surface and harvested for reuse.  The beer was then pumped with sterile air into clarification tanks.  Isinglass was added to clarify the beverage, and then it was bottled.After packaging, the bottles were stored from three to five weeks at 14\u201318 \u00b0C (57\u201364 \u00b0F) in a dark room as the yeast continued to ferment the remaining sugars in the beer.  The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in the bottles and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of carbonation.  During this period, an average of four to five percent of the bottles would burst due to carbonation levels exceeding the strength of the bottles.\n\nHistory\nThe first documented mention of the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski was from around 1257 as part of lands owned by the Cistercian monastery in Parady\u017c. The town grew in prominence due to its location on the road between Pozna\u0144 and Gubin, a road that continued onward to Saxony. By the 16th century, the Ostror\u00f3g family in Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) controlled the town. The Ostror\u00f3g family was a source of support for the Protestant Reformation in the area, and the town became a center of Protestantism in the country and attracted dissidents from the Czech lands and Western Europe. Craftsmen, scholars, and writers gravitated to the area, which became a center of reformist thought in Wielkopolska. Industrial-scale brewing developed when Johann Volanus, the administrator of the Ostror\u00f3g estate and father of Andreas Volanus, a famous Reformation writer, imported skilled brewers from Moravia and Bohemia.A legend associated with the history of this beer relates to the Benedictine monk named Bernard of W\u0105brze\u017ano. Around 1603, he arrived from the Benedictine monastery in Lubi\u0144 to find the residents starving and the town's wells depleted. The brewery was the primary source of income for the city and the hospital. Bernard prayed for the wells and a new source of water suddenly filled the Old Market well. Legends claimed that the newly refilled well had the ability to make whoever drank from it healthy again, and the beer that was produced from the water was far superior to any of the beer the brewers had been able to produce before. The well became a municipal treasure and was given credit for the commercial success of the breweries over the centuries to follow. For over 200 years after the event, the residents of Grodzisk would make an annual procession to Bernard's monastery to bring a keg of the beer that they made from the well as a show of gratitude.\nA maltsters' and brewers' guild existed in the town in 1601. The guild created a monopoly on the right to produce malted grain and beer for sale, and kept it in the hands of a select few families, strictly controlled by the guilds. It also implemented rules and regulations on the production of the beer that was designed to protect the quality and reputation of the beer. A system of quality control was put in place; each barrel of beer that was produced was subjected to a beer tasting by the mayor of the town and a council of elders who evaluated its quality and strength and approved the beer for sale or export with a distinctive stamp. Brewers who attempted to cheat the system of quality control were permanently stripped of their right to produce the beer. The guild also organized the production of beer by the major breweries, which shared the Old Market well. In 1843 and 1844, there were two breweries in Grodzisk that shared the well. By 1866, the city had begun taxing the breweries for their use of the municipal wells. Two private breweries built their own wells, and found that the water was just as good as the water from the Old Market. Following this discovery, all of breweries eventually built their own wells.The earliest documentation of the beer being exported to other regions is from records in the nearby town of Wschowa from 1671. Rules established by the local hatters' guild established that the penalty for charging less than 12 groschen for dying a hat was a barrel of Grodziskie. In 1694, the nearby city of Pozna\u0144 listed a bill for expenses that included entries for \"Grodzisk beer\" at the rate of 15 guilders per barrel that had been purchased as gifts for important people. At that cost, it can be seen that the product was valued as a premium beverage, since local beer produced in Pozna\u0144 at the time cost only five to six guilders per barrel. Other records from Pozna\u0144 in 1712 show that the two mayors of the city were receiving Grodziskie beer as a portion of their compensation for their service. By the 18th century, the beverage's reputation had spread throughout Poland, and it became one of the most expensive beers in the country.Between 1793, when Grodzisk became part of Prussia as a result of the Second Partition of Poland, and 1918, when it became part of a newly independent Poland, the town was renamed Gr\u00e4tz, and the style became known as Gr\u00e4tzer. Records show that annual production of the beer in Gr\u00e4tz was about 3,200 barrels (5,000 hectoliters, 4,300 U.S. bbl), of which 1,111 barrels were transported to Pozna\u0144, 1,581 barrels to other nearby towns, including Wschowa, Ko\u015bcian, Leszno, Rawicz, Bojanowo, Kalisz, and \u015amigiel, and 500 barrels were sold within Gr\u00e4tz. In the late 19th century, the beer was being exported into neighboring provinces and other parts of Germany. German immigrants moved to Gr\u00e4tz and built modern breweries, breaking the monopoly that had been held by the brewer's guild. By the 1890s, the five breweries in Gr\u00e4tz produced over 100,000 hectoliters (85,000 U.S. bbl) of beer, with Gr\u00e4tzer produced in the largest quantities. It was exported to other parts of Europe and the world and gained fame as a highly valued beverage. Its peak of popularity occurred just prior to the second World War, when it was being exported to 37 countries.\nStarting in 1922, the production of Grodziskie was continued by only one company, Zjednoczone Browary Grodziskie (United Grodzisk Breweries). Between 1929 and 1993, this style had a regionally protected designation put in place by the cabinet of Poland. Production continued under the German occupation of Poland during World War II, and the beer was distributed to German forces fighting in the war. After the Second World War, the breweries were nationalized, and the beer began a period of decline. The communist government in Poland emphasized the large-scale production of basic products like bread, milk, and sugar, and local culinary traditions were neglected. In part, this was due to restrictions on individual businesses and the inability of brewers to profit from the production of small-scale, high-quality foods, and their inability to advertise local goods and specialties. In the early 1980s, different variations of the style were created with different colors and alcohol strengths. After the Communist period in Poland ended in 1989, production continued under the private ownership of Lech Browary Wielkopolski, but ended in 1993, when the brewery was closed due to lack of profitability, and because of the difficulty in finding workers who had experience producing the style. Commercial production of this style ceased for several years, but since 2010, some breweries have produced seasonal or limited production runs of the style.After the close of the brewery, Grodziskie continued to be brewed by some homebrewers in Poland using 100% smoked wheat. In 2011, the Polish Homebrewers Association formed a commission for the revival of the Grodziskie beer. Even though the style has taken different forms over the years, the purpose of the commission was to develop guidelines that describe a mild version that former brewery workers could identify, even though some brewers and homebrewers have experimented with variations that include different amounts of alcohol and bitterness. Grodziskie was defined in the Brewers Association style guidelines in 2013, and added as a Historical Style to the Beer Judge Certification Program style guidelines in 2015.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBrowar w Grodzisku, a brewery in Grodzisk Wielkopolski, opened in 2015\nGrodziskie Redivivus at the Polish Home Brewers' Association (in Polish)",

        "body": "Liquid smoke is a water-soluble yellow to red liquid used as a flavoring as a substitute for cooking with wood smoke while retaining a similar flavor. It can be used to flavor any meat or vegetable. It is available as pure condensed smoke from various types of wood, and as derivative formulas containing additives.\n\nHistory\nPyrolysis or thermal decomposition of wood in a low oxygen manner originated prehistorically to produce charcoal. Condensates of the vapors eventually were made and found useful as preservatives. For centuries, water-based condensates of wood smoke were popularly called \"wood vinegar\", presumably due to its use as food vinegar. Pliny the Elder recorded in one of his ten volumes of Natural History the use of wood vinegar as an embalming agent, declaring it superior to other treatments he used. In 1658, Johann Rudolf Glauber outlined the methods to produce wood vinegar during charcoal making. Further, he described the use of the water insoluble tar fraction as a wood preservative and documented the freezing of the wood vinegar to concentrate it. Use of the term \"pyroligneous acid\" for wood vinegar emerged by 1788.\nIn the United States, in 1895, E. H. Wright inaugurated the era of commercial distribution of pyroligneous acid under a new name, liquid smoke. Among Wright's innovations were the standardization of the product, marketing and distribution. Wright's Liquid Smoke, since 1997 owned by B&G Foods, and its modern-day successors have always been the subject of controversy about their contents and production, but in 1913, Wright prevailed in a federal misbranding case. Case judge Van Valkenburg wrote:\n The Government, in trying to show that this is not smoke produced by combustion, has shown that it is produced in exactly the same kind of way that is stated on that label. The fact is that they have produced something here which they say has something of the flavor and properties similar to the curative properties of smoke; they get it out of wood and they get it by distillation and it turns out to be a substance like, if not exactly identical with pyroligneous acid. Well, nobody could be deceived into thinking it was specifically what the indictment charges they are being deceived with. It is a thing which is produced in such a manner from the art and methods employed in it, that the application of the term \"smoke\" to it seems to me to be apt or applicable instead of deceptive, and it does not deceive in the sense this statute implies.\nHistorically, all pyroligneous acid products, Wright's product and many other condensates have been made as byproducts of charcoal manufacturing, which was of greater value. Chemicals such as methanol, acetic acid and acetone have been isolated from these condensates and sold. With the advent of lower cost fossil fuel sources, today these and other wood derived chemicals retain only small niches. Today there are many manufacturing locations around the world, most of which pyrolyze wood primarily to generate condensates which are further processed to make hundreds of derivative products. These are now referred to less as liquid smoke products, and instead as smoke flavorings, smoke flavors, and natural condensed smoke.\n\nProduction\nThe condensed products from the destructive distillation of wood are called \"liquid smoke\" or \"pyroligneous acid\". There are no standards of identity, prescribed production methods, or tests which distinguish between liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid; they can be considered to be the same. However, the numerous variables that are manipulated during pyrolysis do lead to a wide range of compositions of the condensates. In addition, implementation of many further processing steps by concentration, dilution, distillation, extraction, and use of food additives has led to the many hundreds of different products on the market worldwide.\nWood, particularly hardwood, is by far the most widely used biomass pyrolyzed to make liquid smoke. Commercial products are made using both batch and continuous methods. Commercial products are made using a range of reactors from rotary calciners, heated screws, batch charcoal kilns, to fast pyrolysis reactors. The process type and conditions of processing lead to greater variances between the condensates than the differences between the common wood types that are in use. Variables such as feed rate, vapor residence time, particle size, oxygen infiltration, and temperature can have substantial effects on yield and composition of the condensates. Wide ranges of chemical composition are reported throughout the literature and unless the process and conditions are cited, there is limited utility of such results. Commercial manufacturers strive to control their manufacturing variables in order to standardize product compositions.\nWater is added either during condensation or after to cause separation of three fractions. Once water is added, the aqueous phase becomes the largest and most useful fraction. It contains wood-derived chemical compounds of higher chemical polarity such as those found in carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and phenol chemical classes. Many compounds together are responsible for the flavor, browning, antioxidant, and antimicrobial effects of smoke and liquid smoke. The smallest condensed fraction is the lowest-polarity upper phase which a mix of phytosterols and other oily, waxy substances. The lower phase is commonly referred to as tar. It is an intermediate-polarity mixture of phenolic polymers, secondary and tertiary reaction products, some of the water-soluble polar compounds partitioned in the amount of which is governed by individual partition coefficients, water and the bulk of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Wood tar has been used as a preservative, water repellent, and antiseptic. Tar from birch was produced as a commodity product on large scale in northern Europe. Today commercial liquid smoke products are still prepared from this phase.\nLiquid smoke condensates are made commercially for the global meat industry in the U.S. and Europe and are regulated by governments. Liquid smoke is still referred to as wood vinegar, and is made and used indigenously in places including Japan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Southeast Asia.\n\nUse\nFood\nThe application of liquid smoke to food has grown to encompass a wide variety of methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. Liquid smoke is used extensively by topical application to replace direct wood-smoking of food. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright's liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization, which is still the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved, and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines are the usual methods of application. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings is also used; meat products are stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another way to impart smoke flavor, used when other technical functions of smoke do not need to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods, or injecting whole muscle meat. The smoke flavors can also be incorporated into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings. Aqueous smoke solutions can also be extracted into oil, spray-dried using maltodextrin carriers, or plated onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.\n\nNon-food\nExtensive references to beneficial uses of pyroligneous acid in plants for seed germination, pest control, microbial control, plant structural enhancements are reported. Livestock benefits such as antimicrobial preservation of feed, nutrient digestibility, and other claims are found. Scientific agricultural studies can be found in peer-reviewed journals, but many agricultural benefits such as soil quality improvement, better seed germination, and healthier foliage are widely promoted without attribution. Broad claims of medical benefits to humans in digestive ailments, dental infections, liver, heart, skin ailments, ears, eyes are found, but the literature is devoid of accepted scientific studies for such testimonial claims in humans.\n\nSafety\nThe first government-sanctioned assessment of liquid smoke was undertaken by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981. The committee commissioned by the FDA to evaluate information on the products concluded there was no evidence demonstrating the products were a hazard to the public the way they were being used. Today, these products stand as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in the United States and may be used at levels necessary to produce the intended technical effects. Manufacturing plants where liquid smoke is made are regulated and inspected by the FDA.\nThe European Union established procedures for the safety assessment and the authorization of smoke flavorings used or intended for use in or on foods in 2003. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was charged with evaluating information on primary condensate smoke flavorings. Information on twelve products from ten applicants were evaluated by EFSA. Opinions were published on all twelve. The products considered were what each applicant considered their own primary product prior to any further processing or derivatization. All twelve products were determined to be genotoxic positive by in vitro methods, but when evaluated by in vivo methods ten were found to not be of concern by EFSA. The AM-01 product was judged inconclusive and FF-B was considered weakly genotoxic. Based upon the NOAEL determinations for each product and supplemental information supplied by some manufacturers, usage limits for most products have been established and are conveyed by manufacturers to users. Most of these primary products and their derivatives remain in commercial use. Only products which are the subjects of these evaluations are authorized to be used in commerce within the EU.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLeffingwell & Associates, Smoke Flavor I.

        "body": "Punjabi cuisine is a culinary style originating in the Punjab, a region in the northern part of South Asia, which is now divided in an Indian part to the east and a Pakistani part to the west. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking.\n\nHistory\nThe local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which was used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.\n\nStyle of cooking\nThere are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), \"the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi\" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called Kath tandoors in Punjabi.\n\nStaple foods\nPunjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India. Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet.\nDairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer. Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of Lassi. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter).\n\nFood additives and condiments\nFood additives and condiments are usually added to enhance the flavor of the food. Food coloring as additive is used in sweet dishes and desserts. Starch is used as a bulking agent.\n\nCommon dishes\nBreakfast\nBreakfast recipes with respect to different regions within Punjab varies. Common ones are chana masala, nan, chole kulche, aloo paratha, paneer paratha, gobi paratha, paratha with curd, paratha with butter, halwa poori, bhatoora, falooda, makhni doodh, Amritsari lassi, masala chai, tea, Amritsari kulchas, dahi vada, dahi, khoa, paya, aloo paratha with butter, panjeeri with milk.\nIn the upper Punjab Pakistan the Lahori Katlama is famous for breakfast as well.\n\nMeat\nPoultry, lamb and goat meat are the preferred meat sources in different regions of Punjab.\nMany dishes of meat variety is available and some of them are named below.\n\nBiryani: lamb, chicken, and beef\nPilaf: Beef and Lamb\nKebab: braised chicken, beef, or lamb meat, commonly served with naan and flat bread.\nKeema: Braised minced lamb meat, commonly served with naan.\nLamb: including rogan josh, Bhuna Gosht, Kadhai Gosht, Raan Gosht, Dal Gosht, Saag Gosht, Nihari, Rara Gosht, Paye da Shorba\nShami kebab, chicken karahi, Amritsari tandoori chicken, Punjabi Karhi (the chicken yogurt curry of Punjab), Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni), chicken tikka, Paye.\nKunna Gosht, slow cooked meat prepared in Kunna (mitti ki bartan (clay utensil))\nHaleem is made of meat (beef or chicken) slow cooked with a mixture of legumes softened by overnight cooking it is a protein rich food with spices and aromatics like nutmeg served with wedge of lemon and saut\u00e9ed onions.\n\nFish\nSince Punjab is a landlocked region, freshwater fish, and not marine fish, forms an important part of the cuisine. Carp, rohu and catfish are the most commonly prepared fish. Other fish types include thela machi and tilapia. Recently, shrimp has been introduced. Fish tikka is an Amritsari speciality.\n\nVegetarian\nKhichdi, a grain-and-lentil dish: In the Punjab, khichdi is made of millet flour, mung beans and moth lentils (Vigna aconitifolia). However, khichdi made of rice and red lentils or mung beans is also consumed.\nRajma, Rajma is the Hindi word for Red kidney beans. Beans are cooked on medium spicy onion-tomato gravy and most often served with steamed rice and sometimes with Indian flatbread called Chapati (Phulka in Punjab region).\nPaneer (freshly made cottage cheese) Recipes like Shahi Paneer; Khoya Paneer, Paneer Kofta (paneer chunks battered and fried, then simmered in a spicy gravy), Amritsari Paneer, Matar Paneer (paneer with green peas), paneer paratha (wheat flatbread stuffed with paneer),Palak Paneer\nPanjiri: This is a traditional North Indian dessert and is popular in Punjab region as well. which has a generous amount of almonds, walnuts, pistachios, dry dates, cashew nuts along with whole wheat flour, sugar, edible gum, poppy seeds and fennel seeds to make the traditional dish of 'panjri' or also known as 'dabra'.\nLegumes: a variety of legumes are used, including chickpeas, pigeon peas, red lentils, mung bean, red kidney beans (originally an import from the Americas) and black gram. Legumes may be used singly or in combination like Dal Makhani\nSaag: a variety of leafy greens (including spinach and mustard greens), typically cooked down to a stew, tempered with ginger, tomato, onion, garlic, chilies and other spices, and often enriched with paneer or cream. Bathua is also added to enhance the flavor. It is served with butter on top and with makki ki roti. Saag is a winter and spring delicacy; it is one of the most popular dishes of Punjab.\nEggplant: Baingan bharta is similar to baba ghanoush in the way the eggplant is prepared by roasting and peeling the skin off, but much richer, with the incorporation of much cooked tomato, browned onion and a variety of spices instead of tahini.\nPunj Ratani Dal: A thick gravy that uses 5 legumes, with tomato, browned onion and spices.\nPunjabi Kadhi Pakora (traditional curry with rice). Kadhi is a type of curry made with yogurt or buttermilk, which is thickened with chickpea flour and seasoned with ginger, turmeric, chilies, and tempered spices. Deep-fried lumps of spiced chickpea-flour batter (pakoras) are also added.\nPunjabi Lassi paneer: In the Punjab, it is traditional to prepare lassi and then extract the paneer which would then be consumed by adding water, salt and chili. Lassi paneer can also be added to potatoes and spices to make a curry which resembles scrambled eggs. Lassi paneer cannot be cut into cubes as paneer from milk can be.\n\nSnacks\nToasted grains: In Punjab, toasting corn and wheat grains on the Punjabi bhathi is a traditional snack preparation.\nSamosas\nGolgappa\n\nRaita and chutney\nAlong with all types of main dishes raita or chutney is also served.\n\nSweets and desserts\nPunjabi cuisine includes various types of desserts and Mithyai which include:\n\nAmritsari\nKheer, dessert made of rice, milk and dry fruits\nKhoya\nKulfi, an ice-cream-like dessert\nMalpua\nRabri\nSemolina-based desserts: Halva\nSheer korma\nKaju katli\nAtte ka halwa (Kadah)\nPude - usually made during the rainy season\nPinni - Made with desi ghee, wheat flour, almond and jaggery\nGulab jamun\nJalebi\nBurfi.\n\nBread\nPunjabis eat a variety of breads. Flatbreads and raised breads are eaten on a daily basis. Raised breads are known as khamiri roti. Sunflower and flax seeds are also added in some breads occasionally. The breads may be made of different types of flour and can be made in various ways:\n\nBaked in the tandoor like naan, tandoori roti, kulcha, or lachha paratha\nDry baked (Indian griddle), jowar di roti, baajre di roti and makki di roti (these are also smeared with white butter)\nShallow fried like paratha\nDeep fried like puri, Kachori and bhatoora (a fermented dough)\nSalt-rising bread: Salt-rising bread is a unique bread found only in the Salt Range region of Punjab, Pakistan. Since rock salt is readily available in the salt range, many people in the past made use of salt instead of yeast to leaven the bread.\nPapar\n Taftan: an Iranian bread very popular in Pakistan and Lahore. It can be eaten with korma and nihari.\n\nHerbs and spices\nIndian subcontinent-based spices are used in Punjabi cuisine, which are ground in a mortar and pestle or a food processor.\n\nBeverages\nPunjab has a diverse range of beverages. Some are dairy-based such as lassi and buttermilk. Water buffalo milk-based products are especially common around Punjab. Examples are mango lassi, mango milkshake, and chaas. Others are juices derived from vegetables and fruits, such as watermelon shakes, carrot juice and tamarind juice (imli ka paani). Shikanjvi and neembu paani drinks are especially preferred during the summer. Jal-jeera is also common as well.\nSattu is a traditional North Indian drink that is also traditionally consumed in the Punjab. Sattu is made by roasting barley grains and then grinding them into powder, mixed with salt and turmeric and water.The local regional drinks in Punjab also include Doodh soda (milk soda), Desi Daaru (a local form of alcohol in India) and Bantay (a local soda drink) in Pakistan.\n\nFermented foods\nFermented foods are common in Punjabi cuisine. Also fermented foods are added in the preparation of some dishes as well. Mango pickle is especially famous in many villages of Punjab.\n\nCooking methods\nTraditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include:\n\nChullah\nThe traditional name of the stove in the Punjabi language is chulla. Traditional houses also have ovens (wadda chulla or band chulla) that are made from bricks, stones, and in many cases clay. Older communities in Punjab also used earth ovens (khadda chulla), but this tradition is dying out now.\n\nBhathi\nA masonry oven is known as a bhathi. Outdoor cooking and grilling have many different types of bhathi. A bhathi is used to roast wheat or corn for which Kalsi (1992) describes as a \"special oven with an open pan in which sand is heated to roast corn.\"\n\nHara\nA hara is a six-foot-tall oven with its own roof. The hara is traditionally used to slow-heat milk or slow-cook pulses such as chickpeas.\n\nTandoor\nAccording to Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History by Mukhtar Ahmed, Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Roy Hayter the original versions of the tandoor \"in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground\". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.\n\nModern methods\nPressure cookers\nIron griddle\n\nEtiquette of Punjabi dining\nEtiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families.\nBringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.\n\nMajor features of etiquette\nAn invitation to a meal or tea is typically distributed few days beforehand. Denying the invitation for no major reason is considered a breach of etiquette.\nTable setting is done before the arrival of the guests.\nFamily members or any occupants within one home make sure to eat together during the dinner. If any other person is present in the vicinity, then they are offered meals as a way of giving respect. It is considered rude to start eating food without asking others to participate in a meal. It is customary to offer food to anyone in your vicinity before eating. The invited guest or elder person is given special respect and attention. Usually the invited guest is requested to start the meal. It is considered rude if the host starts eating without taking into account the attendance of all guests.\nPunjabi families use a hybrid style of South Asian and European utensil etiquette most of the times. The bread and rice are eaten with the hands. Desserts are eaten with spoons. Soup spoons are used for consuming soup and forks are used for eating noodles. Chewing food with one's mouth open and burping in front of others is considered rude. In the villages of Punjab, an additional common plate is usually placed on the table for any bones left from the consumption of bone meat. Placing leftovers on the floor or on the table floor is considered bad etiquette.\n\nPunjabi dhaba\nThe roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers. They can also be a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of the greasy spoon.\n\nPunjabi restaurants\nPunjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946 and is the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world's first Punjabi restaurant to earn One Michelin Star in 2019.\n\nSee also\nIndian cuisine\nPakistani cuisine\nLahori cuisine\nPunjabis\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Smoked beer (German: Rauchbier) is a type of beer with a distinctive smoke flavour imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame.\n\nHistory\nDrying malt over an open flame in a smoke kiln may impart a smoky character to the malt.  This character may carry over to beers brewed with the smoked malt. Before the modern era, drying malted barley in direct sunlight was used in addition to drying over flames. Even though hot air kiln drying of malt, using indirect heat, did not enter into widespread usage until the industrial era, the method was known as early as the first century BC. Also, there have been various methods over the years of preparing cereal grains for brewing, including making beer from bread, so smoked beer was not universal.\nBeginning in the 18th century, hot air kiln drying of malt became progressively more common and, by the mid-19th century, had become the near-universal method for drying malted grain. Since the hot air kiln method prevents any smoke from coming into contact with wet malt, a smoky flavour is not imparted to the grain, nor to the subsequent beer. As a result, smoke flavour in beer became less and less common, and eventually disappeared almost entirely from the brewing world.\n\nBamberg Rauchbier\nCertain breweries maintained the smoked beer tradition by continuing to use malt which had been dried over open flames. The malt is dried over fires made from beechwood logs. The malt and fermenting beer are stored under the pub and brewery in a part of the catacombs of Bamberg, a maze of tunnels under the city built from the 11th century onward, which have a very stable moisture and temperature. In former times, ice was used to cool the fermenting beer tank room, the Lagerkeller. This ice was locally harvested above ground in the winter, although when the winter was too mild, ice was imported from as far away as Finland or Sweden. The beer is then filtered to clarify it and remove yeast remnants, and put into oaken vats. Two brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany, Schlenkerla and Spezial, have continued this type of smoked beer production for more than a century. Several varieties of Rauchbier (\"smoked beer\" in German) are produced by these companies. Both are still in operation today, alongside seven other breweries in the same town. Since the rauchbier tradition was continuously preserved in Bamberg, the beer style is now marketed as Bamberg Rauchbier. \nDue to the popularity of craft beer in recent years, smoke-flavoured  industrially-produced malts became available, and so the style has been attempted worldwide, including in its heartland of Franconia and Bamberg. Schlenkerla and Spezial, however, use a traditional, elaborate way of smoke malting. In 2017 Slow Food included these two Rauchbiere in their Ark of Taste.The Brewers Association distinguishes three variations of Bamberg-style Rauchbier: Helles , M\u00e4rzen, and Bock. Each is brewed according to the underlying style, but with smoked malts replacing some or all of the mash bill.\n\nGrodziskie\nGrodziskie or Gr\u00e4tzer are similar, traditional smoked beers from Poland, but made from wheat and highly carbonated, and with a perhaps older history, although they saw a period of no production in the late 1990s.Grodziskie traditionally contain 2.7\u20133.7% alcohol by volume with little to no hop flavor or aroma, and medium-low to medium bitterness. Typical coloration is straw to gold.\n\nSmoked beers outside Germany and Poland\nIn Australia, the Feral Brewing Company and Nail Brewing, both in Western Australia, make a smoked porter. In addition Gulf Brewery, in South Australia, make a Smoke Stack rauchbier.\nIn Belgium, the Dupont Brewery produces Triomfbier Vooruit, a saison produced with smoked malt.\nIn Brazil, Eisenbahn produces a smoked beer called Eisenbahn Rauchbier, using malts imported from Bamberg.\nIn Bulgaria, Britos produces \"\u041e\u043f\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430\" with \"malted barley smoked over an open flame\".\nIn Canada, Les Trois Mousquetaires makes a smoked beer, and Half Pints Brewing Company the seasonal Smoktoberfest. Also, Church-Key brewing of Campbellford, Ontario produces a peat smoked Scotch ale called Holy Smoke. Cameron's brewing in Oakville, Ontario produces Bamburg Castle smoked ale. Moosehead Breweries Small Batch label now produces a smoked lager using magnum hops.\nIn Chile, Cervecer\u00eda La Monta\u00f1a produces Yuta, a smoked Munich dunkel (5.6% abv) with traditional German ingredients, although it does not follow the classic base beer styles from Bamberg's Rauchbiere.\nIn Italy, Birrificio Lambrate make two smoked stout beers, the draught or bottled Ghisa (5% ABV) and the bottled Imperial Ghisa (8.5%).\nIn Lithuania, Dundulis brewery produces a smoked beer called Juodvarni\u0173.\nIn the Netherlands, Emelisse produces a traditional German-style smoked beer, as well as a smoked porter and a peated Russian imperial stout. Brouwerij De Molen has several different smoked beers, such as Bloed, Zweet & Tranen and Rook & Vuur. Othmar also produces a traditional smoked beer, named Rauchbier.\nIn Norway, Haandbryggeriet produces a smoked, juniper-flavoured beer called Norwegian Wood.\nIn the United Kingdom, Meantime Brewery produced Winter Time, a smoked old ale, and Kelham Island Brewery in Sheffield made Brooklyn Smoked Porter in association with Brooklyn Brewery. Adnams bottles its Smoked Ruby (4.7% ABV) using cherry wood and has brewed a similar, limited edition, 1659 Smoked Ruby Ale. Beavertown brews a smoked porter called Smog Rocket.\nIn the United States, the Alaskan Brewing Company, Great Basin Brewing Company, New Glarus Brewing Company, Revolution Brewing, Surly Brewing Company, and Samuel Adams make and distribute smoked beers influenced by the Rauchbier of Bamberg.\nIn Ireland, Black Donkey Brewing  seasonally brews \"Bog Fire\", a wild ale, using a portion of locally turf (peat) smoked malt, and fermented with a wild local yeast. The 2023 release had additionally been aged in ex-Irish-whiskey barrels for three years.\n\nSee also\nGr\u00e4tzer\nList of beer styles\nList of smoked foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBrewery Schlenkerla\nBrewery Spezial (in German)\nBambergs brewing tradition\nBJCP style guidelines for smoked beer",

        "body": "Bosnian smoked cheese (Bosnian: Suhi dimljeni sir or Dimljeni sir) is a type of very dry piquant low-fat smoked cheese originating from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is usually home-made product, but industrial production also exists.\n\nHistory\nNorthern Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich agricultural history. Farmers in the region became skilled in the techniques of smoking and salting as methods of meat preservation prior to the introduction of commercial refrigeration, and used these methods to develop local meat dishes such as suho meso. Smoking was also adopted in the production of dairy products, including cheese. Similar smoked cheeses are also found in other countries in the Balkans, including Croatia and Serbia.\n\nPopularity and consumption\nBosnian smoked cheese is usually consumed as a supplement to the main and side dishes, or as a substitute for other cheese variations.\n\nAlso see\nList of Bosnia and Herzegovina cheeses\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Lebkuchen (German pronunciation: [\u02c8le\u02d0p\u02ccku\u02d0xn] ), Honigkuchen or Pfefferkuchen (pronounced [\u02c8p\u0361f\u025bf\u0250\u02ccku\u02d0xn\u0329] ) are honey-sweetened German cakes, moulded cookies or bar cookies that have become part of Germany's Christmas traditions. They are similar to gingerbread.\n\nEtymology\nThe etymology of Leb- in the term Lebkuchen is uncertain. Proposed derivations include: from the Latin libum (flat bread), from the Germanic word Laib (loaf), and from the Germanic word lebbe (very sweet). Another likely possibility is that it comes from the old term Leb-Honig, the rather solid crystallized honey taken from the hive, that cannot be used for much beside baking. Folk etymology often associates the name with Leben (life), Leib (body), or Leibspeise (favorite food). Kuchen means 'cake'.\n\nHistory\nBakers noticed that honey-sweetened dough would undergo a natural fermentation process when stored in a cool location for several weeks, creating air bubbles that would improve the quality of the bread. Lebkuchen was started in November and baked in December after undergoing this fermentation period.Lebkuchen was invented by monks in Franconia, Germany, in the 13th century. Lebkuchen bakers were recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm, and 1395 in N\u00fcrnberg (Nuremberg). The latter is the most famous exporter today of the product known as N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen (Nuremberg Lebkuchen).\nLocal history in Nuremberg relates that emperor Friedrich III held a Reichstag there in 1487 and he invited the children of the city to a special event where he presented Lebkuchen bearing his printed portrait to almost four thousand children. Historically, and due to differences in the ingredients, Lebkuchen is also known as \"honey cake\" (Honigkuchen) or \"pepper cake\" (Pfefferkuchen). Traditionally, the cookies are usually quite large and may be 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in diameter if round, and larger if rectangular. Unlike other cities where women could bake and sell the holiday cookies at will, in Nuremberg only members of the baker's guild were allowed to bake the cookies.\nSince 1808, a variety of N\u00fcrnberg Lebkuchen made without flour has been called Elisenlebkuchen. It is uncertain whether Elise was the daughter of a gingerbread baker or the wife of a margrave. Her name is associated with some of the Lebkuchen produced by members of the guild. Since 1996, N\u00fcrnberger Lebkuchen is a protected designation of origin, meaning that it must be produced within the boundaries of the city.\n\nTypes\nLebkuchen range in taste from spicy to sweet and come in a variety of shapes with round being the most common. The ingredients usually include honey, spices such as aniseed, cardamom, coriander, cloves, ginger, and allspice, nuts including almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts, or candied fruit.In Germany, types of Lebkuchen are distinguished by the kind of nuts used and their proportions. Salt of Hartshorn and potash are often used for raising the dough. Lebkuchen dough is usually placed on a thin wafer base called an Oblate. This was an idea of the monks, who used unleavened communion wafer ingredients to prevent the dough from sticking. Typically, they are glazed or covered with very dark chocolate or a thin sugar coating, but some are left uncoated.\n\nLebkuchen is usually soft, but a harder type of Lebkuchen is used to produce Lebkuchenherzen (\"Lebkuchen hearts\"), usually inscribed with icing, which are available at many German regional fairs and Christmas fairs. They are also sold as souvenirs at the Oktoberfest and are inscribed with affectionate, sarcastic or obscene messages.Another form is the \"witch's house\" (Hexenh\u00e4usl or Hexenh\u00e4uschen), made popular because of the fairy tales about Hansel and Gretel.\nThe closest German equivalent of the gingerbread man is the Honigkuchenpferd (\"honey cake horse\").\nThe Nuremberg type of Lebkuchen is also known as Elisenlebkuchen and must contain no less than 25 percent nuts and less than 10 percent wheat flour. The finest artisan lebkuchen bakeries in Nuremberg boast close to 40% nut content. Lebkuchen is sometimes packaged in richly decorated tins, chests, and boxes, which have become nostalgic collector items.Several Swiss regional varieties also exist and have been declared part of the Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, such as the case with Berner Honiglebkuchen.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAachener Printen\nBasler L\u00e4ckerli\nBerner Haselnusslebkuchen\nSpringerle\nSpeculaas\nList of chocolate-covered foods\nList of German desserts\nLicitar\nPfeffern\u00fcsse\nPryanik\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLebkuchen on the German Food Guide\nGermans fall out of love with Lebkuchen at The Guardian\n593 Lebkuchen recipes on Chefkoch.de as of 4 March 2013 (in German)\nLebkuchen in the online Culinary Heritage of Switzerland database.",

        "body": "Acme Smoked Fish Corp. is the largest producer of smoked salmon in North America, and is also a manufacturer and seller of pickled herring and other smoked and cured seafood products. Acme Smoked Fish has US-based facilities located in New York City, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Florida, as well as international locations in Chile and Denmark. Acme Smoked Fish Corp. is a privately held, family-owned company, that has been headquartered in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn since 1954.\n\nHistory\nHarry Brownstein founded what would eventually become Acme Smoked Fish in 1906, shortly after emigrating from Russia. In Brownstein's early days buying and selling smoked fish in Brooklyn, he did so from a horse-drawn wagon throughout several Brooklyn neighborhoods before setting up a brick-and-mortar location in the Brownsville neighborhood during the 1930s. In 1941, Rubin Caslow of Arcee Sales, a prominent smoked fish seller in Brooklyn at the time, joined Harry Brownstein's smoked fish company after marrying Charlotte Brownstein, the daughter of Harry Brownstein. In 1954, Acme Smoked Fish was officially incorporated and began manufacturing in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the company's current international headquarters.In 1966, Acme's Brooklyn facility had to be rebuilt after a major fire destroyed the plant. Soon after the reconstruction of the facility the company began its pickled herring division. In 1969, Acme Smoked Fish founder Harry Brownstein died, leaving the company to his sons Joseph and Morton Brownstein and son-in-law Rubin Caslow. In 1975, to accommodate growth and increasing production requirements, Acme purchased the building next door to their Brooklyn facility, bringing the company to occupy a full New York City block.In 1970 and 1972, respectively, Robert and Eric Caslow joined Acme Smoked Fish as the company's third generation of owner operators. In 1978 Acme Smoked Fish introduced its first commercial line of consumer packaged good smoked salmon and lox products.Acme Smoked Fish acquired another company for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Great American Smoked Fish of Pompano Beach, Florida, establishing a new headquarters for Acme Smoked Fish of Florida, LLC, which began as a regional distribution center in 2005. In 2015, Acme opened the largest smoked salmon facility in the United States in Wilmington, North Carolina. Also in 2015, the company opened Acme Chile in Puerto Montt, Chile, making Acme Smoked Fish Corp. multinational for the first time in the company's history.In 2019, Acme Smoked Fish acquired Spence & Co. Ltd. of Brockton, Massachusetts. In 2020, Acme made another acquisition in the form of a majority stake in Norlax A/S, a producer of smoked fish products based in Outrup, Denmark. Currently, Acme Smoked Fish is managed by its fourth generation of owner operators, Adam Caslow, David Caslow, and Emily Caslow.\n\nIn Popular Culture\nAcme Smoked Fish partnered with New York City-based Zucker's Bagels in 2018 in an attempt to make the world's largest bagel, cream cheese, and smoked salmon sandwich. The final product weighed 213 pounds. The attempt was featured on Inside Edition, but was never certified as a world record by Guinness World Records.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "The blueback herring, blueback shad, or summer shad (Alosa aestivalis) is an anadromous species of herring from the east coast of North America, with a range from Nova Scotia to Florida. Blueback herring form schools and are believed to migrate offshore to overwinter near the bottom.\nThese fish are silvery in color, have a series of scutes (modified, spiny and keeled scales) along their bellies, and are characterized by deep bluish-green backs.  They reach a maximum size of approximately 40 centimetres (16 in) and are believed to live up to 8 years. The most distinguishing characteristic of this species is the black to dusky color of its peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity).  It is one of the \"typical\" North American shads.  They are often confused with alewifes because blueback shad and alewives are difficult to distinguish from one another, and together these two species are often regarded collectively as \"river herring\". Alewives have larger eyes, greater body depth, and pearly to white peritoneal linings.\nThis fish has, in the past, been used as a baitfish for the lobster fishing industry. It is also used for human consumption, usually smoked. It is caught (during its migration up stream) using large  dip nets to scoop the fish out of shallow, constricted areas on its migratory streams and rivers.\n\nRange\nThe native range of this fish is found along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to the St. Johns River, Florida. During spawning season, it migrates into coastal rivers.\n\nNon-indigenous occurrences\nBlueback shad were first collected in Lake Ontario in 1995, and have been collected from the Tennessee River in Georgia and Tennessee; Oneida Lake, the Oswego River, and Lake Champlain in New York. In North Carolina, blueback shad were introduced into the Savannah, Broad, and Yadkin River basins, and into non-native areas of the Cape Fear and Roanoke River basins. It has been introduced to an unspecified location in the Chesapeake Bay basin in Pennsylvania.  They have been collected in Lake Jocassee, Lake Keowee, Picalet River, Broad River, and Lake Murray in South Carolina.  Stock obtained from the Cooper River, South Carolina, was released in Texas by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in Lake Theo, Briscoe County, and at an unidentified research site in North Texas in 1982 (and in the upper Red River drainage). Bluebacks have been collected from Lake Champlain, Vermont, and have been stocked in several inland reservoirs in Virginia, including Smith Mountain Lake, Occoquan Reservoir, Kerr Reservoir, and Lakes Anna, Brittle, and Chesdin. It is established as a species in Texas, New York, North Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia.\n\nEcology\nThis fish is anadromous, living in marine systems and spawning in deep, swift freshwater rivers with hard substrates. It migrates to spawning grounds in the spring. In Connecticut, blueback shad spawn in 14 to 17 \u00b0C (57 to 63 \u00b0F) water, usually later in the spring than the alewife. During spawning, many eggs are deposited over the stream bottom, where they stick to gravel, stones, logs, or other objects. Juveniles spend three to seven months in fresh water, then migrate to the ocean. The blueback shad is a planktivorous forage species.\n\nReproduction\nBlueback herring spawn from late March through mid-May, depending on latitude. Females usually mature by age five and produce between 60,000 and 103,000 eggs.  Males generally mature earlier at between 3 and 4 years of age and at a smaller size than the females. For both species, adults migrate quickly downstream after spawning and little is known about their life history while in the marine environment; however, they are believed to be capable of migrating long distances (over 1,900 kilometres (1,200 mi)).\n\nConservation\nBlueback populations have exhibited drastic declines throughout much of their range.  There are several threats that have most likely contributed to their decline.  These threats include: loss of habitat due to decreased access to spawning areas from the construction of dams and other impediments to migration; habitat degradation; fishing; and increased predation due to recovering striped bass populations.\nIn response to the declining trend for river herring, the states of Alabama, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia, Delaware and North Carolina have instituted moratoriums on taking and possession.\nThe blueback herring is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern. Species of Concern are those species about which the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\nReferences\n\nFaria, R.; Weiss, S. & Alexandrino, P.

        "body": "Eyemouth is a small town and civil parish in Berwickshire, in the Scottish Borders area of Scotland. It is two miles (three kilometres) east of the main north\u2013south A1 road and eight miles (thirteen kilometres) north of Berwick-upon-Tweed.\nThe town's name comes from its location at the mouth of the Eye Water. The Berwickshire coastline consists of high cliffs over deep clear water with sandy coves and picturesque harbours. A fishing port, Eyemouth holds a yearly Herring Queen Festival. Notable buildings in the town include Gunsgreen House and a cemetery watch-house built to stand guard against the Resurrectionists (body snatchers). Many of the features of a traditional fishing village are preserved in the narrow streets and \"vennels\".Eyemouth is not far from the small villages of Ayton, Reston, St Abbs, Coldingham, and Burnmouth, all in Berwickshire.\nThe coast offers opportunities for birdwatching, walking, fishing and diving. Accommodation includes several hotels, B&Bs and a holiday park.\n\nA 16th-century artillery fortress\nFort Point at Eyemouth was the site of the first trace-italienne-style fortification in Britain, built on a spur or peninsula overlooking the existing harbour during the war known as the Rough Wooing. Building commenced in 1547 by the English military engineer Sir Richard Lee (1513\u20131575), and it cost \u00a31,906. Some of the stone was brought from a demolished tower at Dunglass Castle, East Lothian and timber was taken from Coldingham Priory.The fort was demolished under the Treaty of Boulogne in 1551. A larger and more complex fort was built in 1557 by d'Oisel and probably the Italian military engineer Lorenzo Pomarelli for the Regent of Scotland, Mary of Guise, when at war with England. The new fortress could hold some 500 French troops, and may have been intended as a staging post to securely store munitions and artillery near Berwick-upon-Tweed and the border with England. However, the new work, which perhaps was never completed, was scheduled for demolition under the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis in 1559. French garrisons remained in Scotland at Dunbar Castle, Inchkeith, and at Leith. Traces of the ramparts are still to be seen.\n\nHistory of Eyemouth\nEyemouth fell within the feudal barony of Coldingham, possessed until the early 17th century by Coldingham Priory, after which it passed to the Home family, who had held lands in that barony since at least the 15th century. All landowners (portioners) within the barony held their properties either by hereditary feu or by a term-renewable, occasionally hereditary, tack (Scots word for a lease) from the barony.\nThe lands between the southern banks of the Eye Water consisted of three estates: Gunsgreen, immediately opposite Eyemouth and Netherbyres, once part of the larger lands of Flemington which stretched all the way to Lamberton. At the beginning of the 17th century Gunsgreen estate was possessed by Alexander Lauder of Gunsgreen, a great-great-grandson of Sir Robert Lauder of The Bass (d.1508). On 17 January 1629, Alexander Lauder of Gunsgreen, acting as bailie for Sir David Home of Wedderburn, gave a sasine to Andrew Gray in Eyemouth, of some land on the boundaries of Houndlaw and also in Eyemouth.\nNetherbyres was for at least 250 years held by the Craw (originally Auchincraw) family. \"George Craw of Netherbyre\" was \"deceased\" by July 1614 when his son William came into possession of that property and Reidhall, \"with the walk mill\" extending to 12 husbandlands (312 acres (126 hectares)). A later William Craw, who had a passion for mathematics, built the first 'modern' harbour at Eyemouth and, in 1715, the elliptical walled garden, the latter almost certainly unique in the world. The Netherbyres House we see today was commenced about 1835 for Captain Sir Samuel Brown, R.N., who had the patent and monopoly for the supply of anchor chain to the Royal Navy. He later went on to design and patent chain suspension piers and bridges, including the Union Bridge over the River Tweed, Still in use today. Netherbyres House was bought by Sir Christopher Furness, 2nd Bt. in 1928, and was donated to Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society for charitable use by his second son, Colonel Simon Furness, the Vice Lord Lieutenant for Berwickshire, who now occupies a house overlooking the walled garden.\nHero William Spears (1812\u20131885), is celebrated by the dramatic bronze statue in Eyemouth Market Place, where he stands pointing the way to Ayton, the scene of his peaceful demonstration. Spears led a revolt against the tithes on fish levied by the Church of Scotland, even after the great Disruption of 1843 when most fishermen left the established Church to join other congregations.\n\nVery soon after the cost of getting the tithes removed had been met, the town was struck by the Eyemouth Disaster when, on 14 October 1881, most of the fishing fleet, some 20 boats and 129 men from the town, were lost in a terrible storm. Including victims from other coastal towns, a total of 189 men lost their lives. This is commemorated in the Eyemouth Tapestry Housed in the Museum.\nA contemporary article offers an interesting insight into Eyemouth in the 1860s:\n\n\"Between St Abbs Head and Berwick, however is situated Eyemouth, a fishing village pure and simple, with all that wonderful\nfilth scattered about which is a sanitary peculiarity of such towns.\nThe population of Eyemouth is in keeping with the outward appearance of the place. As a whole, they are rough, uncultivated,\nand more drunken in their habits than the fishermen of the neighbouring villages. Coldingham Shore, for instance, is only\nthree miles distant, and has a population of about one hundred fishermen, of a very respectable class, sober and well dressed,\nand \"well to do.\" \u2013 The Fisher Folk of the Scottish East Coast, \"Macmillian's Magazine\" No.36 October 1862.\n\nIn the late 18th century, with the arrival of a group of Dutch engineers in the town, a survey was undertaken for a canal linking Eyemouth to Duns. The plan would have involved damming the Whiteadder Water at Chirnside thus diverting the course of the Whiteadder Water through the low-lying area known as Billiemire to join the Eye Water near Ayton. The plan was never carried out.\nFrom 1891 until 1962, the town was served by a short branch railway line that ran from Burnmouth on the present-day East Coast Main Line. The line was forced to close from August 1948 to June 1949 after being damaged by the flooding of the Eye Water.\nJohn Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough was created Baron Eyemouth in the Peerage of Scotland in 1682. This was the first of his peerage titles.\n\nTransport\nThe A1 road, the main Edinburgh \u2013 Newcastle route, puts the town within commuting distance of Edinburgh.\nEyemouth railway station served the town until it was closed in 1962. The nearest railway station is Reston railway station, The 253 operated Borders Buses stops at Reston railway station\n\nEducation\nEyemouth Public School, in Albert Road, was built in 1876, designed by the architect William Gray Junior.Children attend Eyemouth Primary School, after which they attend Eyemouth High School.\nThere is a further education training centre in the town. Northumberland College in Berwick-upon-Tweed is eight miles (13 km) away, and full-time further and higher education courses are offered at Borders College and Heriot-Watt University's textiles campus in Galashiels.\n\nMedia\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC Scotland and ITV Border. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter. Eyemouth's local radio stations are BBC Radio Scotland on 94.1 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Scottish Borders and North Northumberland on 103.4 FM.\nThe Border Telegraph and Southern Reporter are the town's local newspapers.\n\nHarbour and industry\nIn 1997, Eyemouth was given EU funding from a scheme to regenerate declining fishing villages and raised matching funds itself to construct a deep water extension to the harbour. Eyemouth Harbour caters for most types of fishery activity and as a result Eyemouth's primary industry has seen a certain amount of rejuvenation. A pontoon has been installed in the harbour to provide ease of boarding for seafarers. Volunteers for Her Majesty's Coastguard and the seagoing RNLI lifeboat are called out by the firing of maroons, one for the Coastguard and two for the Lifeboat.\nThere is a boatyard which carries out works to fishing and commercial vessels. The new harbour and fish market has toilets and showers which are available to visiting seamen \u2013 contact the Eyemouth Harbour Harbourmaster. The visitor centre explains the methods of fishing, the types of nets and the vessels used and examples of the equipment of a typical fishing boat are displayed. Visitors can see the market in action in the early mornings from a viewing platform. Boats are available for hire for sea fishing, sightseeing and diving in one of the few marine reserves in Britain.\nThe Eyemouth pale is a cold-smoked haddock, distinct from varieties such as Finnan haddock by its lighter, golden hue, and subtler smoked flavour, achieved by a shorter smoking time.\n\nPolitics\nThe elected Eyemouth Town Community Council is led by a Chairman and has 12 members, including an Honorary Provost. Three representatives of Scottish Borders Council attend monthly public meetings in order to take on board and act upon feedback from the community councillors, who serve as a voice of the people of the town. Eyemouth Town Community Council (a Scottish Community Council), meets on the last Monday of the month (except in December) at 7.00pm in the community centre, minutes of the meetings being displayed on their website, on two notice boards in the town and also in the Berwickshire News.\n\nAttractions\nThe wide sandy bay is flanked by high cliffs. Despite being sheltered by Hurkur Rocks, storms can generate high waves and throw high plumes of spume into the air over the sea wall. It is named \"The Bantry\", said to be in affectionate memory of the Irish labourers from the fishing town of that name in County Cork who constructed it.\nThe 18 hole golf course and clubhouse have sea views and a restaurant which is open to the public, allowing patrons to enjoy panoramic views as they eat.\nDivers come from all over the world to enjoy the St Abbs and Eyemouth Voluntary Marine Reserve with its unique marine flora and fauna.\nEyemouth also has a great leisure centre consisting of a state-of-the-art gym, a studio, a sauna and two swimming pools, one small with a maximum depth of less than 3 feet and a big pool with a minimum depth of 3 feet to a maximum depth of 10 feet.\n\nNearby places of interest\nOther places of interest nearby include the fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed also designed by Sir Richard Lee, and its military museum, Paxton House, the Union Bridge and the Chain Bridge Honey Farm, and scores of quiet country roads skirting the Cheviot Hills, frequently snow-capped in winter. Many visitors pause on their journey on the A1 to photograph their arrival in Scotland or their departure to England at the border crossing. Though the border has significance to many visitors, most residents of Eyemouth consider themselves Scottish rather than British. Nearby the border is a nature trail through the mysteriously named 'Conundrum' Farm. Typical Border towns and villages, such as Kelso, Grantshouse, Abbey St Bathans, Cove, Cockburnspath (pronounced 'coburnspath' or 'copath' by locals), Cornhill, Wooler, Morpeth, Alnmouth and Alnwick are all within easy reach for day trips from Eyemouth. Near Chirnside stood Ninewells House, since demolished, where Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume spent much of his life.\n\nPopular culture\nITV's Taggart was filmed on occasion at St Abbs and Coldingham Sands.\nEyemouth is the setting for a novel by Susanna Kearsley titled The Shadowy Horses.\nEyemouth is the home of the Queen of the Underworld in H.P. Mallory's series of Jolie Wilkins books.\nAvengers Endgame was filmed at nearby, featuring St Abbs as the harbour town of New Asgard and the overlooking cliffs where Thor asks Valkyrie to be King. Parts of Thor love and Thunder were also filmed at St Abbs\n\nSee also\nList of places in the Scottish Borders\n\nNotes\nReferences\nRev.

        "body": "The goldeye (Hiodon alosoides) is a freshwater fish found in Canada and the northern United States.  It is one of only two extant species in the family Hiodontidae, the other species being Hiodon tergisus.  The species name alosoides means shad-like. It is also called Winnipeg goldeye, western goldeye, yellow herring, toothed herring, shad mooneye, la Queche, weepicheesis, or laquaiche aux yeux d\u2019or in French.\n\nMorphology\nGoldeyes are recognizable by their silver compressed body form and their large gold eyes.  Their body appears to be a blue-green silver from above and a more white silver from below.  They have two abdominal and pelvic fins as well as a dorsal on their back and an anal fin on their underside.  The dorsal fin is positioned opposite or behind the origin of the anal fin.  Goldeyes also have a fleshy keel that extends from the pectoral fins to the base of the anal fin. Their mouth is large and in the terminal position with a blunt round snout.  There are teeth present on the tongue, the roof of the mouth on the parasphenoid bone and the palatopterygoid arch:\u200a267,\u200a280\u200a and along the jaws.  The goldeye fish has cycloid scales that lack spines.  They also have a sensory system known as the lateral line system.  Adults are usually about 15\u201317 inches (380\u2013430 mm) but can reach 20 inches (510 mm). Goldeyes typically weigh only 1\u20132 pounds (0.45\u20130.91 kg).\n\nReproduction\nThe age of first reproduction for goldeyes is 7\u201310 years for females and 6\u20139 years for males.  They spawn in late May or early June.  The eggs that they lay are about 4 millimetres (0.16 in) in size and they are semi-buoyant.  This is a rare trait in fresh water fish, but is more common in marine fish.  The eggs are suspended in the water and they drift downstream or to quiet waters.  The majority of growth that occurs between June and September.\n\nRange\nGoldeyes occur from as far down the Mackenzie River as Aklavik in the north to Mississippi in the south, and from Alberta in the west to Ohio south of the Great Lakes, with an isolated population south of James Bay. It prefers turbid slower-moving waters of lakes and rivers.\n\nDiet\nGoldeyes feed on insects, crustaceans, fish and frogs. The fish averages less than 1 lb (450 g) or 12 in (30 cm) in length, but can be found up to 2 lb (910 g) or 16 in (41 cm) in some lakes.  It has been reported up to 52 cm (20 in) in length.\n\nFishing\nThe goldeye is considered a good fly-fishing fish, but not popular with most anglers because of its small size. It is one of 122 new species of animals, birds, fish documented by the Lewis & Clark Corps of Discovery. Commercial fishing of this species was reported as early as 1876.  Its fresh flesh is soft and unappealing, so it was only taken randomly in gillnets and (in the past) sold for dogfood. They are now sought after by many consumers as a smoked fish. Many commercial fishermen sell them smoked after being processed (marinated) in a brine made of spices, salt, brown sugar, and other secret ingredients. They are smoked in oak wood, apple wood, or other woods. Each producer has their own ways of smoking. Despite its soft flesh the goldeye may be soaked in a salt brine for 24 hours and then poached, firming up the flesh.\nIts commercial viability was realized by Robert Firth, who immigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba from Hull, England in 1886.  Firth was carrying on a mediocre trade in cold-smoked goldeye, when he miscalculated the heat of his smoker and accidentally developed the now-standard method of hot-smoking it whole.  The bright red or orange colour of the smoked fish resulted from using only willow smoke, but today is achieved through aniline dye. It became a fashionable gourmet dish after 1911, with Woodrow Wilson and the Prince of Wales counted amongst its fans.  In 1926\u201329 the annual catch exceeded a million pounds, but stocks declined from 1931 and little was fished from Lake Winnipeg after 1938.  A small amount of the commercial harvest is shipped to the United States, but most is consumed in Canada.  Although Lake Winnipeg was once the main commercial source, it now comes from elsewhere, especially in Saskatchewan and Alberta, and the culinary name Winnipeg goldeye has come to be associated with the city where it is processed.The fish is the namesake of Winnipeg's minor league baseball team, the Winnipeg Goldeyes.\n\nSee also\nList of smoked foods\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nMcClane, A.J.

        "body": "Lysekil (Swedish pronunciation: [\u02c8l\u0177\u02d0s\u025b\u02cc\u0255i\u02d0l]) is a locality and the seat of Lysekil Municipality in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County, Sweden. It had about 7,600 inhabitants in 2018. Situated on the south tip of St\u00e5ngen\u00e4s peninsula at the mouth of Gullmarn fjord, it has two nature reserves.\nOriginally a small fishing village, it developed into a town for fishing industries, commercial shipping and trade during the 18th and 19th centuries. Stone industry based on the red Bohus granite from quarries in the town, was also vital to Lysekil up until the 1950s. One of Sweden's largest oil refineries, Preemraff Lysekil is situated outside the town.\nDuring the 19th century, Lysekil was established as a prominent spa and bathing resort and tourism still makes up a large part of the town's economy.\n\nHistory\nLysekil is first mentioned in 1570. It was originally an estate belonging to Lyse farm further inland. The population lived mostly on fishing and commercial shipping. The first settlement was on the north side on the tip of St\u00e5ngen\u00e4s peninsula, where a natural, sheltered harbor is formed by a bay in Korn\u00f6 fjord. The area is known today as North Harbour (Norra Hamnen). Before fixed lighthousees were built in the area, the local inhabitants would light false beacon fires, causing ships to run aground. Pillaging wrecks and also killing sailors who defended their stranded ships, was common along the coastline. During the Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), Lysekil was one of the harbors along the Swedish west coast where privateering became sanctioned by the government through the issuing of letters of marque. Charles XII of Sweden needed ships and men for the navy and one of the ways to get this was to give private ships and captains permission to seize and capture enemy ships and their crews.\nWhen herring fishing peaked after 1750, fishing industries flourished in Lysekil. The main export products were salted herring and train oil made from boiled herring to extract the oil. During the Age of Sail, Lysekil became a center for fishing, shipping and transport. At the mid 1800s, the fishing village had a number of sailing ships. In 1909, 18 large sailing ships and 10 steamboats were registered in Lysekil. The harbor records that same year show 6,832 ships, including 185 foreign, coming and leaving.\nDuring the second part of the 1800s, Lysekil developed into a bathing resort. The first warm water bath house was made from the cabin of a ship and the first real house was built in 1849. In 1859, Carl Curman became resident physician at the resort. He had studied the climate along the west coast and found Lysekil to be best suited for a spa town and through his contacts, the town became a resort favoured by the Stockholm socialite. New bathhouses, hotels and parks were built in 1864\u20131890 along the south side of the town, now known as the South Harbor (S\u00f6dra Hamnen). Among those were the two Curman Villas built in Dragestil.During World War II was one of the ports involved in Operation Bridford during which fast ships, called \"Blockade runners\", could break through the German Skagerrak mine blockade and ship ball bearings to Kingston upon Hull, England. The same route was later used to bring supplies and ammunition from Britain to the Danish resistance movement.\n\nGeography\nLysekil is situated on the south tip of the St\u00e5ngen\u00e4s peninsula on the Swedish west coast at the mouth of Gullmarn fjord. The town is surrounded on three sides by the sea and a number of islands and islets. The largest islands are Stora and Lilla Skeppsholmen, Sk\u00e4lholmarna, Valboholmen, Humles\u00e4cken, St\u00e5ngholmen, Sl\u00e4gg\u00f6, Gr\u00f6t\u00f6, and Tova.Lysekil is surrounded by harbors, piers, boardwalks and quays on all sides facing the sea. The two main harbors are North Harbor and South Harbor. At the North Harbor, the original small wooden cottages and houses from the first settlement, Gamlestan (Old Town), have been restored and rebuilt into a picturesque part of the town. Both the north and the south harbors have guest harbors as well as plenty of restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n\nNature reserves\nThere are two nature reserves in Lysekil, St\u00e5ngehuvud and Gullmarn fjord. The red granite cliffs of St\u00e5ngehuvud were bought for conservation purpose in 1920 by Calla Curman and in 1982, the area was established as a nature reserve. The cliffs make up the southwest end of St\u00e5ngen\u00e4s peninsula. In 1983, Gullmarn fjord was designated as Sweden's first marine conservation area.\n\nEconomy\nStarting out as a small fishing village, Lysekil developed into a place for fishing industry and refined fish products. Large amounts of train oil were also produced and exported to European countries as well as New York to be used in street lamps. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were around 40 factories in Lysekil. In 1893, Arvid Bernhard \u00d6hnberg started the A. B. \u00d6hnberg Canning Company which included the Ejderns brand, all now owned by Abba Seafood. They produced a special sort of caviar that is still one of the most popular sandwich spreads in Sweden. Lysekil Caviar, often referred to as creamed smoked roe, differs from normal caviar in that its main ingredients are cod roe, canola oil, sugar, onion, tomato sauce and salt; it is also often seasoned with dill. Kalles Kaviar is the best-known brand.\nGranite quarries and stonemasonry were part of Lysekil's industries in 1850\u20131950. The granite was much in demand for buildings and street paving in Britain, Germany, Denmark, Belgium and Argentine. In 1909, there were five quarries in Lysekil.Tourism became a vital source of income for Lysekil in the 1850s. The town was established as a fashionable bathing resort. In 2018, tourism is still vital for the town's economy. It has branched out to include more activities underwater diving, kayaking, sports fishing and seal safaris.One of the largest oil refinery in Sweden, Preemraff Lysekil, situated a few miles outside the town, is one of the main employers in the area. Plans to build a refinery near Lysekil started in 1945 when the Swedish consumer-owned oil company Oljekonsumenters Riksf\u00f6rbund (OK), was formed. Negotiations for building the refinery were long and hard, and it was not until 1975 that it was inaugurated.\n\n2017 port project proposal\nIn late November 2017, pro-Beijing businessman and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Gao Jingde, on behalf of a consortium led by Hong Kong-listed Sunbase International (Holdings) Ltd of which he is chairman, proposed building Scandinavia's largest port at Lysekil.\n\nTransport\nIn 1910, Lysekil was connected with the rest of the Swedish railway network through the Lysekil Line, a branch railway of the Bohus Line. Passenger transport in the line, ceased in 1983, while some freight use remained. Maintenance in the line continued until 2016 with only a few trains running during summer. On 9 December 2018, all maintenance and traffic on the line will cease as the switch in Smedberg is disconnected.The public transportation bus network in Lysekil is operated by V\u00e4sttrafik. The network also includes a ferry, M/S Carl Wilhelmson (line 847), between Lysekil and Fiskeb\u00e4ckskil on the other side of Gullmarn fjord. Another ferry service across the fjord from Lysekil, is the car ferry operated by Trafikverket F\u00e4rjerederiet.\n\nSights and events\nHavets Hus is a public aquarium showcasing the animals living in the sea surrounding Lysekil. The aquarium cooperates with the Institute of Marine Research, part of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.\nVikarvets Museum is a Working Life Museum with exhibits about life in the old days in Bohusl\u00e4n.\nChateaux Luna at Caf\u00e9 Luna in Lysekil, is one of the few vineyards in Sweden producing its own wine.\nLysekil Women's Match is an annual match racing sailing competition in Lysekil.\nLysekil Cruising is an annual cruising event held on Midsummer's Eve. With around 1,500 vintage cars, the event is one of the biggest in Sweden, occupying the whole town during the Midsummer weekend.\n\nNotable people from Lysekil\nNathalie Djurberg (born 1978) \u2013 artist\nBert Lundin (1921\u20132018) \u2013 union leader\nWilliam Matson (1849\u20131917) \u2013 Swedish-American shipping executive.\nFredrik Risp (born 1980) \u2013 Swedish football player.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nLysekil Project\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLysekil's official tourism website",

        "body": "Back bacon is a cut of bacon that includes the pork loin from the back of the pig. It may also include a portion of the pork belly in the same cut. It is much leaner than side bacon made only from the pork belly. Back bacon is derived from the same cut used for pork chops. It is the most common cut of bacon used in British and Irish cuisine, where both smoked and unsmoked varieties of bacon are found.\n\nCanadian bacon\nCanadian bacon (or Canadian-style bacon) is the term commonly used in the United States for a form of back bacon that is cured, smoked and fully cooked, trimmed into cylindrical medallions, and sliced thick. The name was created when this product was first imported from Toronto to New York City. \"Canadian\" bacon is made only from the lean eye of the loin and is ready to eat. Its flavor is described as more ham-like than other types because of its lean cut.The term \"Canadian bacon\" is not used in Canada, where the product is generally known simply as \"back bacon\" while \"bacon\" alone refers to the same streaky pork belly bacon as in the United States. Peameal bacon is a variety of back bacon popular in Ontario where the loin is wet cured before being rolled in cornmeal (originally yellow pea meal); it is unsmoked.\n\nSee also\nList of smoked foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Back bacon at Wikimedia Commons\n\"A Guide to Bacon Styles, and How to Make Proper British Rashers\" at thepauperedchef.com weblog",

        "body": "Barbecue bologna or smoked bologna is a barbecue dish from the US state of Oklahoma. It has been nicknamed  Oklahoma tenderloin, Oklahoma prime rib, or Oklahoma steak. It is also sometimes served in Tennessee and Texas.\n\nDescription\nThe dish is prepared by smoking a tube, or \"chub\", of bologna sausage, typically over pecan wood. The outside of the bologna is scored in a square or diamond pattern before smoking, allowing the smoke to penetrate and flavor the meat. The sausage may be coated with apple juice during the smoking process to keep it moist.The bologna may be made of beef, pork, chicken, or any combination of those meats. Sometimes the meat is seasoned before smoking. Sweet spice rubs are preferred because of the natural saltiness and high nitrate content of the bologna. Slices of smoked bologna are often grilled before consumption, and then dressed in a tomato and mustard-based barbecue sauce.Barbecue is typically eaten as a sandwich on a bun or white bread, sometimes in combination with other barbecue meats. It is also a component of a barbecue platter.\n\nHistory\nBarbecue bologna was created in Oklahoma. It is hypothesized to have become popular because of bologna sausage's low price in comparison to other popular barbecue meats. The dish has been nicknamed Oklahoma tenderloin, Oklahoma prime rib, and Oklahoma steak. Barbecue bologna's city of origin is debated, but is often credited to barbecue restaurants in either Tulsa or Oklahoma City. The dish is considered to be a staple of Oklahoma barbecue. Food Network Magazine named the smoked bologna sandwich as the sandwich that represented the state of Oklahoma in 2012.\nSmoked bologna is also commonly served in Tennessee as part of Memphis-style barbecue. During the 2010s, it began to be served in Texas restaurants as well, despite not being a traditional part of Texas barbecue.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Kabanos (; plural: kabanosy), also known as cabanossi or kabana, is a long, thin,  dry sausage usually made of pork which originated in Poland. They are smoky in flavor, and can be soft or very dry in texture depending on freshness. Typically, they are quite long, 60 cm (24 in), but very thin, with a diameter around 1 cm (0.39 in), and folded in two, giving them a characteristic appearance. Versions made of chicken and turkey are staples in kosher meat markets and delicatessens.\n\nEtymology and history\nThe name comes from the word kaban, an old obsolete term used in eastern parts of Poland for a young male pig fattened with potatoes specially for making this kind of sausage (hence kabanos - \"made of kaban\"). The word kaban with a similar meaning is also present in other neighbouring languages; it was initially loaned from Turkic languages where it denotes a boar.Kabanosy are known to have been produced since medieval times at least, and because of their long-lasting capabilities they were considered perfect food for soldiers and travellers, which is reflected by kabanos' design traits: thinness, usually very extended length, and shape in which they are always kept. According to some historians, they were hung around the neck (like a necklace), allowing horsemen to eat on the go without stopping for a food break. For the same reason, they were also used as hiking food and are very common among Polish Highlanders. Tighter, smaller wraps of long kabanosy - as sold nowadays - were also common among foot soldiers (and travellers). Smaller kabanos wrapping allowed it to be \"worn\" on a wrist and eaten while marching.\nNowadays, kabanosy are made using different spices, and come in many different flavours. Before the 20th century, various spices were also being used in the production of kabanosy, giving them locally distinct tastes, which differed between various regions of Poland.\n\nModern times\nProduction of kabanosy requires a minimum of 150 grams of best grade pork meat to make 100 grams of sausage, which is known today as the \"minimum of 3:2 ratio\". This is required because of the loss of some of the water contained within the meat used to prepare the raw sausage, which evaporates during the long process of meat smoking.\nNowadays almost every Polish manufacturer of kabanosy describes on the packaging at which ratio their sausage was made; for example, the manufacturer Kania states that \"157 grams of meat was used to make 100 grams of kabanosy\".The two main types of kabanosy include a slightly \"softer\" and more common type (smoked much less, just for the taste), and a \"harder\" type (much drier than the softer ones), which are smoked for a very long time, basically until bending the sausage becomes difficult (to the point that it cracks when someone attempts to bend it). Because of the long and thorough smoking process, the \"harder kabanos\" type is extremely long-lasting and does not spoil as quickly as most other meats without preservatives.\nFurthermore, kabanosy are also categorized into two other main types, depending on the amount of spices used: \"hot\" (very spicy) and \"mild\" (less spicy). Both \"harder\" and \"softer\" types of kabanosy come in \"hot\" or \"mild\", since the \"hardness\" of the sausage comes only from the length of its smoking time, but otherwise the two are made of the same ingredients.\nAccording to modern recipes, kabanosy are currently seasoned with different spices, such as black pepper, chili, and others. Unlike other meats, these sausages are typically eaten alone as an appetiser or are often served with cheese. Although kabanosy can be cooked with other food, they are usually served cold only. Only if no other meat were available to Polish travelers or soldiers would they then have sliced kabanos into small pieces to cook them with vegetables, buckwheat, millet, potatoes, or whatever else was available.\nIn recent years, some manufacturers have created sausages made with the same process as kabanosy, but have substituted the traditional pork with other meat (mainly poultry). Due to their distinct shape and look, they are often called kabanosy, too, with the addition of the name of the meat they contain, e.g. kabanosy z kurczaka, \"chicken kabanosy\".\n\nServing\nIt is commonly cut into bite-sized chunks and eaten cold as an appetiser or snack, often with cheese and crackers. Small cabanossi, called minicabanossi, are also available. Sliced cabanossi is also a popular pizza topping.\n\nDistribution\nThe kabanos sausage is mostly found in Southern, Central and Eastern European countries from the Adriatic Sea to the Baltic states, and is also very popular in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Israel, and Peru, where the sausage is one of the most prevalent dried sausages. In Central and Eastern Europe, kabanos is mostly consumed as a snack. In Israel, because of dietary laws (Jewish kashrut and Muslim halal), kabanos sausage is almost exclusively made of chicken and/or turkey. Kabanos is also fairly popular in Colombia, where it is called c\u00e1bano.\n\nTraditional Speciality Guaranteed: Kabanosy staropolskie\nAfter the accession of Poland to the European Union, Poland and Germany became involved in a trade dispute over the name kabanos (due to a German claim to the traditional Polish recipe). In 2011, when Polish manufacturers submitted scientific proofs of Kabanos' Polish origins, the EU registered Kabanosy staropolskie as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed  on request of Poland. This status does not forbid manufacturers from other countries to produce and sell kabanos under that name, but demands that when using the name \"Kabanosy staropolskie\", it is made according to specified \"time-honoured recipes\".\n\nSee also\nList of sausages\nList of dried foods\nList of smoked foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nRecipe",

        "body": "Hungarian sausages are sausages found in the cuisine of Hungary. Hungary produces a vast number of  sui  sausage types. They may be boiled, fresh or dried, and smoked, with different spices and flavors, \"hot\" or \"mild\". Many were influenced by their neighbors and brethren.\nThese sausages may be eaten like a cold cut or used in a main course. Hungarian cuisine uses these different types of sausages in many ways such as in stews, soups, potato stews like \"paprik\u00e1s krumpli\" (paprika-based stew with spicy sausage and potatoes), bean soups like J\u00f3kai bableves, some goulash soup variations, pastry dishes, or even in salads.\nThe smoked sausages may contain bacon, ground pork, beef, boar or lamb, paprika, salt, garlic, black pepper, allspice, white pepper, caraway, nutmeg, zest, marjoram, cayenne pepper, sugar, white wine or cognac. Sausages may have additional ingredients like liver, mushroom, bread, rice, lemon juice, eggs, cream or milk.The meat is coarsely ground and salted. If garlic is added, it is mashed in water to produce a slurry and added to the meat along with spices. The sausage is then stuffed into natural casings in 1-foot links - usually using the small intestine of the pig. This traditionally took place outside on the fall day when a pig was slaughtered. The sausage is then hung overnight to allow the flavors to meld and some of the grease to drip out. It is now ready to be used fresh and unsmoked. The unsmoked sausages are typically roasted with sauerkraut or red or green cabbage, and served with mashed potatoes.\nThe dry sausages are cold smoked and hung to cure before consumption.\n\nCooked sausages\nKolb\u00e1sz\nKolb\u00e1sz is a traditional Hungarian smoked sausage seasoned with paprika. The best known and most popular versions are:\n\nGyulai sausage is named after the Hungarian town of Gyula, and has PGI protection. It is slow cooked while being beech wood smoked. It is made from pork, 'szalonna' (Hungarian bacon fat), garlic, pepper, caraway, and a Hungarian red paprika. At the World Exhibition of Food in Brussels 1935, the Gyulai kolb\u00e1sz  was awarded a gold diploma. The sausage may be cut into thin slices and eaten alone or with bread. They are also added to many Hungarian dishes including lecs\u00f3 and potato/egg casserole (rakott krumpli).\nCsabai sausage is made in the town B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba, and also has Protected Geographical Status (PGI) protection. It is similar to Gyulai, but somewhat spicier. There are several variations in size and type, but it is a spicy sausage with a lot of paprika.\nCsemege kolb\u00e1sz is an mildly spiced cooked smoked sausage\nCserk\u00e9sz kolb\u00e1sz is a cooked smoked sausage made from beef and pork.\nDebreceni kolb\u00e1sz is usually unsmoked or more mildly smoked, with a strong paprika flavour and used for cooking.\nLecs\u00f3kolb\u00e1sz, a spicy cooked smoked sausage made specifically for serving as part of the dish lecs\u00f3, a vegetable stew with peppers and tomatoes.\n\nHurka\nHurka are boiled sausages that come in two main types \"m\u00e1jas\" (liver sausage), and \"v\u00e9res\" (blood sausage). The main ingredient is liver and rice, or blood and rice.  Spices, pepper and salt are added.\n\nOther cooked sausages\nVirsli, a hot dog\u2013like long and thin sausage, consumed boiled with bread and mustard.\nP\u00e1rizsi  (Parizer or Paris sausage), is a much larger, thicker version of virsli. It is very similar to the Bologna.\n\nUncooked sausages\nSzal\u00e1mi\nHungary's most famous salami is t\u00e9liszal\u00e1mi (winter salami).\n\nSee also\nList of dried foods\nList of smoked foods\n\nReferences\nCsabai Kolb\u00e1sz\n\nExternal links\nHungarian sausage, (Kolb\u00e1sz)\nHungarian sausage\nA compilation of sausage recipes",

        "body": "A spit cake is a European-styled cake made with layers of dough or batter deposited, one at a time, onto a tapered cylindrical rotating spit. The dough is baked by an open fire or a special oven, rotisserie-style. Generally, spit cakes are associated with celebrations such as weddings and Christmas. The spit can be dipped in a thin dough, or the dough can be poured or rolled on the spit. \nThis cake group may have originated in the classical era, around 400 BC, when similar large cakes were prepared on spits for Dionysiac feasts. In the Deipnosophistae, the Ancient Greek writer Athenaeus (c. 170 \u2013 c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in classical times. Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.\n\nPreparation techniques\nThe cooking process is similar for all the spit cakes: they all consist of a dough applied on a spit which is slowly rotated over an open fire or other heat source. One way of doing this is when the spit is dipped several times in a bowl with liquid dough or the thin dough is poured on a spit. Depending on the dough's consistency and the spit's speed, it will form a layer on the spit, and when very runny, it will drop, thus producing small spikes, giving the cake a coral-like appearance. The resulting cake consists of many layers of cooked dough, and when cut is shown to consist of rings \u2013 hence another name, \"tree cake\".Alternatively, the dough is wrapped around the spit as spiral threads. In some varieties of the cake, while they maintain the shape of the spit cake, the rings are actually baked separately and attached to each other with icing. Some spit cakes have a smooth surface. Others, like spettekaka and \u0161akotis, have an irregular shape.\n\nVarieties\nVariations on the basic process are found in many countries and cultures; what they have in common is that the laborious and time-consuming process produces a cake suitable for special occasions, such as weddings or Christmas feasts. Some varieties are made with a dough with flowing paste while others use a more solid dough. In Austria, spit cakes  are known as Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen; in Germany there are two varieties called Baumkuchen and Baumstriezel; in Hungary k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs; in Romania K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs (also known as Colac/Cozonac secuiesc, or Baumstriezel); in the Czech Republic and Slovakia trdeln\u00edk; in Sweden spettekaka; in Lithuania \u0161akotis, bankuchenas or baumkuchenas; and in Poland s\u0119kacz.Baumkuchen and Baumstriezel are German varieties of spit cake. Baumkuchen is prepared in the shape of a tree and is served sliced in rings that resemble tree rings, and thus gave the cake its German name, Baumkuchen, which translates as \"tree cake\". Baumstriezel is made of a batter made with yeast, and has a caramel crust while the Baumkuchen is not baked with yeast but with baking powder, and has no crust of caramelized sugar. Baumkuchen has as its ingredients eggs, marzipan, sugar, butter and flour. Baumkuchen is served plain or with white sugar icing or covered with chocolate. This type of cake is known in Austria as Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen and  in Luxembourg called Baamkuch, traditionally served on special occasions, such as weddings. The Austrian Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen or Pr\u00fcgeltorte is a variety of spit cake with a  liquid base dough poured on the spit.K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is made of a dough made of wheat flour, egg, yeast, often extra egg yolks, milk, and butter, iced with sugar. The sugar will be caramelised, creating a hard, crisp brown layer on the cake's surface.Its Slovak version is called trdeln\u00edk or Skalick\u00fd  trdeln\u00edk , and it was registered in December 2007 as PGI (protected geographical indication) in the European Union. The registration application with the detailed description of the product was published in April 2007 in the Official Journal of the European Union. It is made from rolled dough that is wrapped around a stick, then grilled and topped with sugar and walnut mix.\u0160akotis is the Lithuanian traditional spit cake, It is a cake made with a loose dough of butter, eggs, flour, sugar, and cream, poured on the spit, forming   \"stalactites\" when dropping from the spit. In Lithuanian means \"peaked\" or \"branchy\"  or \"branched tree\" due to its conical shape resembling a pine tree, and with the drips looking like the tree branches. It is baked in a time- and labor-intensive process, by pouring layers of dough onto a rotating spit in a special open oven or over an open fire.Spettekaka is a traditional dessert of a Southern part of Sweden, mostly of Scania region and is an important part of culinary heritage. Spettekaka is different in that the dough is made of potato flour. The ingredients are potato starch flour, sugar and  eggs. The rest of the process is similar, the thin dough forming layers when it is slowly poured onto a rotating cone shaped spit. The final layer of pink or white icing can be applied at the end of baking. The Spettekaka is a brittle and dry variety of this dessert, somewhat similar in consistency to meringue; it is light, airy and crisp. Those cakes range in size anywhere from a few inches to several feet in height and over a foot in diameter. Cutting Spettekaka with a regular knife is nearly impossible due to crumbling, therefore a special saw-like knife is used. During celebrations there is a tradition to cut out small rectangle windows from the sides of the cake, keeping the whole shape intact as long as possible.\nSpit cake varieties\n\nSee also\nDobos torte\nList of cakes\nList of pastries\nList of spit-roasted foods\nPrinzregententorte\nSpekkoek\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDubois, U.; Gastronomy, K.G.B.C.

An example of authentic Mongolian and Buryatian cuisine, the dish is traditionally eaten at home during Tsagaan Sar, the Lunar New Year. These days it is also offered at restaurants and small cafes throughout the capital city of Ulaanbaatar.\n\nHistory and function\nBuuz is the Mongolian version of the steamed dumpling which is commonly found throughout the region. Etymologically, it reveals its origin to China, as baozi (Chinese: \u5305\u5b50; pinyin: ) is the Mandarin word for steamed dumpling. They are eaten in great quantities throughout the year but especially during the Mongolian New Year celebrations, which usually fall in February. Buuz are prepared in the weeks before and left outside to freeze; they are consumed with salads and fried bread, accompanied by suutei tsai (Mongolian tea) and vodka.\n\nIngredients and preparation\nBuuz are filled with minced lamb and mutton or beef, which is flavoured with onion and/or garlic and salted. Occasionally, they are flavoured with sprouted fennel seeds and other seasonal herbs. Mashed potato, cabbage, or rice may be added as well.\nThe meat ball is then placed inside a small pocket of dough which is folded around the ball with a small opening at the top and in the chef's own personal style. The buuz is then steamed and eaten by hand, with the dough pocket catching the juices of the meat.\nThe filling in buuz is similar to another Mongolian dumpling, khuushuur; however, the latter is fried.\n\nSee also\nKhuushuur\nG\u00fcrz\u0259, the Azerbaijani equivalent\nKhinkali, the Georgian equivalent\nGyoza, the Japanese equivalent\nJiaozi and baozi, Chinese equivalents\nMandu, the Korean version\nMant\u0131, the Turkic/Central Asian version\nModak, the Indian equivalent\nKozhukkattai, the Tamil equivalent\nMomo, Nepalese and Tibetan equivalent\nPelmeni, the Russian equivalent\nVareniki, the Ukrainian/Polish/Lithuanian equivalent\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBuuz recipe from mongolfood.info",

        "body": "Chinese steamed eggs or water egg is a traditional Chinese dish found all over China. Eggs are beaten to a consistency similar to that used for an omelette and then steamed. It is sometimes referred to as egg custard on menus.\n\nPreparation\nThe eggs are beaten and water added to create a more tender texture. A good ratio of water to eggs is 1.5:1. Sesame oil, soy sauce, or chicken broth may be used to add additional flavor. \nOther solid ingredients (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) may also be added to the mixture. The egg mixture is poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked.  The eggs should be steamed until just firm, so that the texture of the eggs is still smooth and silky.  A plate is usually placed on top of the bowl containing the egg mixture and left on while the egg is being steamed.  Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam.Using four eggs, the average cooking time is 10 minutes with water, 7 minutes with chicken broth. However, this is in addition to the time needed for pre-boiling water.\n\nOther cooking methods\nThis same dish can be cooked in a microwave, or in a pressure cooker. Both methods take less time, although the end product may not be of the same quality.\n\nVariations\nHomemade versions might include scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients are added to the egg mixture before steaming. It can also be enjoyed with soy sauce. The taste is usually savory (as opposed to a sweet custard).\n\nSee also\nChawanmushi \u2013 A Japanese egg custard dish\nGyeran jjim \u2013 Korean steamed eggs\nList of egg dishes\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nChinese Steamed Egg.

Danja is also smaller than injeolmi and tends to be globular rather than angulate.Another similar rice cake, gyeongdan, shares the letter dan (\ub2e8; \u5718). Gyeongdan, unlike danja, is usually boiled before it is coated. Typical coatings also differ. Japanese dango, which also shares the letter dan, can be either boiled or steamed, and is not necessarily coated.\n\nPreparation and varieties\nDanja is made by steaming glutinous rice flour in a siru (steamer), pounding the steamed tteok, shaping it into chestnut-sized balls with various coatings that are sweetened with honey, and coating the balls with honey followed by powdered or shredded ingredients. Common fillings are finely chopped gyulbyeong (Mandarin orange boiled in honey), cooked and sieved chestnuts mixed with cinnamon powder and honey, and geopipat-so (white, dehulled red bean paste) mixed with cinnamon powder and honey. Common coatings are cooked with sieved chestnuts, shredded jujubes, chopped pine nuts, cinnamon powder, and toasted sesame seeds.Common varieties include:\n\nbam-danja (\ubc24\ub2e8\uc790) is filled with a mixture of steamed and sieved chestnuts and finely chopped gyulbyeong (mandarin orange boiled in honey), and coated with honey followed by steamed and sieved chestnuts.\ndaechu-danja (\ub300\ucd94\ub2e8\uc790) is made from glutinous rice flour steamed with shredded jujubes and coated with honey followed by shredded jujubes and shredded chestnuts.\neunhaeng-danja (\uc740\ud589\ub2e8\uc790) is made from glutinous rice flour steamed with ginkgo powder, and coated with honey followed by chopped pine nuts.\ngeonsi-danja (\uac74\uc2dc\ub2e8\uc790) is made by wrapping a mixture of powdered chestnuts, cinnamon powder, and honey with thinly sliced gotgam (dried persimmon) preserved in honey, and coating it with chopped pine nuts.\npat-danja (\ud325\ub2e8\uc790) is filled with red bean paste sweetened with honey, and coated with honey followed by steamed and powdered red beans.\nseogi-danja (\uc11d\uc774\ub2e8\uc790) is made from glutinous rice flour steamed with soaked and minced rock tripe mixed with honey, and coated with honey followed by chopped pine nuts.\nseunggeomcho-danja (\uc2b9\uac80\ucd08\ub2e8\uc790) is made from glutinous rice flour steamed with angelica powder, filled with red bean paste and coated with honey followed by steamed and powdered red beans.\nssuk-danja (\uc465\ub2e8\uc790) is made from steamed glutinous rice flour pounded with minced mugwort, filled with honey and chestnuts or yuja-cheong (yuja marmalade) with jujubes, and coated with honey followed by steamed and powdered geopipat (white, dehulled black adzuki beans).\nyuja-danja (\uc720\uc790\ub2e8\uc790) is made from glutinous rice flour steamed with yuja zest, filled with sieved chestnuts and covered with honey followed by steamed and powdered geopipat (white, dehulled black adzuki beans).\n\nSee also\nDango\nGyeongdan\n\n\n== References ==",

It is usually prepared with peeled beans.It is similar to moin-moin as both are made from peeled black-eyed peas or, occasionally, cowpeas. However, unlike moi-moi which is mixed with pepper and other ingredients before steaming, Ekuru is wrapped up in leaves or tin cans (similar to moi-moi) and steamed.It is often prepared in the same way as ordinary moin moin but does not include any additional ingredients. It has a white color and tastes like stew. It goes well with solid pap (eko).It is served with fried pepper stew and then mashed up with pepper stew. Some people enjoy the meal with fermented maize pudding (Ogi or Eko) it can also be served alongside (Eba) Cassava Pudding or Okro Soup.\nThe meal is native to people from South-Western Nigeria, predominantly from Osun State.\n\nIn culture\nEkuru features in several Yoruba myths, where it is cooked with glue in an attempt to stop a cabal of evil witches from moving.Because of the meal's dry nature, the expression \"He chokes me like ekuru\" can be used to describe a tedious visitor.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nYuntunmian.

        "body": "Eo-mandu (Korean: \uc5b4\ub9cc\ub450; Hanja: \u9b5a\u9945\u982d; \"fish dumpling\") is a half-moon-shaped mandu (dumpling) prepared with filleted whitefish, most typically brown croakers, instead of flour dough as the wrapping. In the past, it formed part of Korean royal court cuisine, and was a popular dish among the yangban (upper class). It was often served at summer birthday tables for elder family members. It is commonly eaten during Buddha's Birthday.\n\nPreparation\nWhitefish, such as brown croakers, flathead grey mullets, red seabreams, or olive flounders, is filleted into thin, 7\u20138 centimetres (2.8\u20133.1 in) long slices, seasoned with salt and ground black pepper, and pounded lightly with the back of the knife. Common fillings include ground beef, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, crumbled tofu, chopped scallions, minced garlic and toasted and ground sesame seeds. The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with kitchen scissors to create the half-moon shapes. The dumplings are then coated with mung bean starch, and cooked either in boiling water or in the steamer lined with Boston ivy leaves. Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).\n\nSee also\nKorean royal court cuisine\nDae Jang Geum\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

The dish is believed to have originated from Dutch Empire slaves of the Dutch West Indies stuffing leftover rinds of Gouda or Edam cheeses with meat table scraps.  The name \"keshi\" is reported to be the Papiamento language rendering of kaas, \"cheese\" in Dutch. Modern keshi yena recipes typically include olives, raisins and chicken as ingredients in the stuffing. While some modern cooks prepare keshi yena in ramekins, others stick to the traditional method of baking the dish in an empty can of sausages, or by wrapping the cheese in plantain leaves.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Mandu (Korean: \ub9cc\ub450; Hanja: \u9945\u982d), or mandoo, are dumplings in Korean cuisine. Mandu can be steamed, boiled, pan-fried, or deep-fried. The styles also vary across regions in the Korean Peninsula. Mandu were long part of Korean royal court cuisine, but are now found in supermarkets, restaurants, and snack places such as pojangmacha and bunsikjip throughout South Korea.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe name is cognate with the names of similar types of meat-filled dumplings along the Silk Road in Central Asia, such as Uyghur manta (\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627), Turkish mant\u0131, Kazakh m\u00e4nti (\u043c\u04d9\u043d\u0442\u0456), Uzbek manti, Afghan mantu and Armenian mant\u02bfi (\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0569\u056b). Chinese m\u00e1ntou (\u9992\u5934; \u9945\u982d) is also considered a cognate, which used to mean meat-filled dumplings, but now refers to steamed buns without any filling.Mandu can be divided into gyoja (\uad50\uc790; \u9903\u5b50) type and poja (\ud3ec\uc790; \u5305\u5b50) type. In Chinese, the categories of dumplings are called ji\u01ceozi (\u997a\u5b50; \u9903\u5b50) and b\u0101ozi (\u5305\u5b50) respectively, which are cognates with the Korean words. In Japanese, the former-type dumplings are called gy\u014dza (\u9903\u5b50), which is also a cognate. In Mongolian, the latter-type dumplings are called buuz (\u0431\u0443\u0443\u0437) and in Nepalese and Tibetan, they are called momo (\u092e\u092e, \u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42)  all of which is also cognates with the former.\n\nHistory\nMandu are believed to have been first brought to Korea by Yuan Mongolians in the 14th century during the reign of the Goryeo dynasty. The state religion of Goryeo was Buddhism, which discouraged consumption of meat. The Mongolian incursion into Goryeo relaxed the religious prohibition against consuming meat, and mandu was among the newly imported dishes that included meat.\nAnother possibility is mandu came to Korea at a much earlier period from the Middle East through the Silk Road. Historians point out many cuisines based on wheat, such as dumplings and noodles which originated from Mesopotamia and gradually spread from there. It also spread east along the Silk Road, leaving many versions of mandu throughout Central and East Asia.A Goryeo-era folk song, \"Ssanghwajeom\", tells a story of a mandu shop (ssanghwa meaning 'dumplings', and jeom meaning 'shop') run by a foreigner, probably of Central Asian origin.\n\nVarieties\nIf the dumplings are grilled or pan-fried, they are called gun-mandu (\uad70\ub9cc\ub450); when steamed, jjin-mandu (\ucc10\ub9cc\ub450); and when boiled, mul-mandu (\ubb3c\ub9cc\ub450). In North Korea, mandu styles vary in different regions of the country. In particular, Pulmuone is releasing cheese dumplings, sweet seed dumplings with sugar and spicy dumplings.\nMul-mandu (\ubb3c\ub9cc\ub450) means \"boiled mandu\".\nGun-mandu (\uad70\ub9cc\ub450) is pan-fried mandu. It is derived from guun-mandu \uad6c\uc6b4\ub9cc\ub450=>\uad70\ub9cc\ub450 to mean \"panned\" dumplings.'.\nJjin-mandu (\ucc10\ub9cc\ub450) is steamed, either in a traditional bamboo steamer or modern versions.\nGullin-mandu (\uad74\ub9b0\ub9cc\ub450), also called gulmandu, is a variety of mandu in a ball shape without a covering. It is mainly eaten in summer.\nWang mandu (\uc655\ub9cc\ub450) is a bun stuffed with pork and vegetables, similar to the Chinese baozi.\nPyeonsu (\ud3b8\uc218), mandu stuffed with vegetables in a rectangular shape. It is mainly eaten in summer and a local specialty of Kaesong, North Korea.\nEo-mandu (\uc5b4\ub9cc\ub450), mandu wrapped with sliced fish fillet. It was originally eaten in Korean royal court and yangban (noble class) families.\nSaengchi-mandu (\uc0dd\uce58\ub9cc\ub450), mandu stuffed with pheasant meat, beef, and tofu, that was eaten in Korean royal court and in the Seoul area during winter.\nSeongnyu-mandu (\uc11d\ub958\ub9cc\ub450), literally \"pomegranate dumpling\" because of the shape.\nSo-mandu (\uc18c\ub9cc\ub450), mandu stuffed with only vegetables, which were originally eaten in Buddhist temples.\nGyuasang (\uaddc\uc544\uc0c1), mandu stuffed with shredded cucumber and minced beef in the shape of a sea cucumber. It is mainly eaten in the summer.\nKimchi-mandu (\uae40\uce58\ub9cc\ub450), mandu with stuffing which contains kimchi. The addition of kimchi gives it a spicier taste compared to other mandu.\nNapjak-mandu (\ub0a9\uc791\ub9cc\ub450), a Daegu specialty. As the name suggests (napjak in Korean means 'flat'), the mandu is not as plump as the other types. A small amount of chopped glass noodles and chopped vegetables go inside the mandu. The mandu is then boiled once and pan-fried once, finished off with a dipping sauce made with soy sauce and red pepper powder, and garnished on top with vegetables.\n\nDishes made with mandu\nManduguk is a variety of Korean soup (guk) made with mandu in beef broth. In the Korean royal court, the dish was called byeongsi (\u9920\u5319) while in the Eumsik dimibang, a 17th-century cookbook, it was called \"seokryutang\" (\uc11d\ub958\ud0d5).\n\nSimilar food\nIn Korean cuisine, mandu generally denotes a type of filled dumpling similar to the Mongolian buuz, a Tibetan-Nepalese momo and Turkic mant\u0131, and some variations are similar to the Chinese jiaozi and the Japanese gyoza.\nThey are similar to pelmeni and pierogi in some Slavic cultures.\n\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2003 South Korean film Oldboy, the protagonist Oh Dae-Su is fed a steady diet of fried mandu, the food that he detests the most, while he is imprisoned. After he is released, he visits various restaurants serving the dish to get clues and determine where he was held captive.\nWonder Girls member Ahn Sohee is often referred to as Mandu due to her cheeks resembling the shape of mandu.\nIn the 2020 DreamWorks animated series Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, Kipo finds a mutated pig and names it Mandu because it resembles the dumpling.\n\nSee also\nMandu-guk\nKozhukkatta\nMandu-gwa\nModak\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nGolden Mandu (Korean Dumplings) (Kate's Global Kitchen, by Kate Heyhoe)\nTraditional Mandu Recipe, Korean-Cooking.com",

It is common in Enugu state and classified as a traditional Nigerian delicacy. It is not exclusively eaten by the Igbo, nor is it universal among the Igbo (most-characteristic of Enugu State); other ethnic groups often eat it (with pap or by itself), and it may be that this is most-common (outside Igboland) in Niger State. Other Igbo names for okpa include \u1ecbgba and ntucha. In Hausa, it is known as gurjiya or kwaruru.The main ingredients in okpa are Bambara nut flour, pepper, palm oil and (a modest amount of) seasoning.

        "body": "Seon (Korean: \uc120) is a traditional Korean dish made from steamed vegetables such as zucchini, cucumber, eggplant or Napa cabbage and stuffed with meat. Although the term is a counterpart of jjim \u2014 a category of dishes that are made by steaming meat or seafood \u2014 the concept is not clearly settled.Other dishes similar to seon include gajiseon (\uac00\uc9c0\uc120, steamed eggplant), gochuseon (\uace0\ucd94\uc120, steamed chili pepper), donggwaseon (\ub3d9\uacfc\uc120, steamed winter melon), museon (\ubb34\uc120, steamed radish), baechuseon (steamed Napa cabbage) and dubuseon (steamed tofu).\n\nPreparation\nTo make a hobakseon (\ud638\ubc15\uc120) or oiseon (\uc624\uc774\uc120), a cucumber (or zucchini) is cut into pieces about 4 to 5 cm. in length and then quartered. The pieces are lightly salted and then slightly squeezed to drain water from them. Beef or chicken, along with onion, is chopped and mixed with seasonings to make the stuffing. Then, prepared pieces of the cucumber are stuffed with the meat and placed in a pot. After that, pour the vegetable broth on the ingredients until they are partially covered with liquid. Soaked and stuffed cucumber boiled or steamed with the sauce for about 5-10 minutes. The dish is served with slices of seogi (\uc11d\uc774, Umbilicaria esculenta), chili threads and egg garnish place on top of the cucumber, similarly to gomyeong (\uace0\uba85, garnishes).\n\nIn historical cookbooks\nAccording to Eumsik dimibang, a Korean cookbook written during mid-Joseon Dynasty, the historical recipe of the donggwaseon (\ub3d9\uacfc\uc120, a variety of seon made with dongga (winter melon)) is very different from today's version. \nThick slices of winter melon are lightly parboiled in the water and put into a bowl with the boiled mixture of ganjang, water and oil. In a new bowl boiled ganjang is mixed with minced ginger and then, poured over the vegetables. Donggwaseon is served with vinegar which is spread over the dish.In Siui jeonseo, a cookbook written in the late 19th century, a recipe of hobakseon (\ud638\ubc15\uc120, a zucchini seon) is similar to the modern one. A zucchini is hollowed out, filled with various condiments and then steamed. A sauce made with vinegar, ganjang and honey is poured over the ready dish. The dish is served with sliced chili pepper, seogi (\uc11d\uc774 Umbilicaria esculenta) and jidan (fried eggs) that are placed on the zucchini and sprinkled with pine nuts.However, the term did not reach its modern meaning until the late 1930s.  Cookbooks that were written before that time use the term very differently. They refer to cheongeoseon (\uccad\uc5b4\uc120, steamed and stuffed herring), yangseon (\uc591\uc120, steamed and stuffed beef intestine), or dalgyalseon (\ub2ec\uac40\uc120, steamed eggs). \nToday, the term \"seon\" refers to dish made from stuffed vegetables.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nJjim\nBokkeum\nMandu (dumpling)\nKorean cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOiseon recipe at the Seattle Times\n(in Korean) Dobuseon recipe at casa.co.kr",

        "body": "A suet pudding is a boiled, steamed or baked pudding made with wheat flour and suet (raw, hard fat of beef or mutton found around the kidneys), often with breadcrumb, dried fruits such as raisins, other preserved fruits, and spices. The British term pudding usually refers to a dessert or sweet course, but suet puddings may be savoury. \nMany variations are strongly associated with British cuisine. Recipes vary greatly and can be desserts or savoury courses. They are typically boiled or steamed, though some baked variations and recipes adapted for microwave ovens exist. Modern recipes may substitute butter or vegetable shortening for the eponymous suet.\nExamples include spotted dick, Christmas pudding, treacle pudding, clootie dumpling, jam roly-poly and many others. Savoury versions include rabbit, chicken, game and steak and kidney pudding.\nThe Sussex pond pudding and the Paignton pudding are local variations of suet puddings.\n\nHistory\nThe suet pudding dates back to at least the start of the 18th century. Mary Kettilby's 1714 A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick and Surgery gives a recipe for \"An excellent Plumb-Pudding\", which calls for \"one pound of Suet, shred very small and sifted\" along with raisins, flour, sugar, eggs, and a little salt; these were to be boiled for \"four hours at least\".Christmas pudding developed from a meat dish. The ancestor of the suet pudding was pottage, a meat and vegetable stew originating in Roman times. This was prepared in a large cauldron, the ingredients being slow cooked, with dried fruits, sugar and spices added. In the 15th century, plum pottage was a mixture of meat, vegetables and fruit served at the beginning of a meal.The name suet pudding refers to the fat mixed with the flour; it is the fat from around the kidneys of mammals. Pudding is a British term often used for steamed dishes, both sweet and savoury, but also for Yorkshire Pudding (a batter dish) and Bread and Butter Pudding (a custard dessert).\n\nAdvantages\nSuet has a melting point of between 45 \u00b0C and 50 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F and 122 \u00b0F). Butter, by comparison, melts between 32 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F to 95 \u00b0F). As a result, suet fat is less likely to melt into the flour when making the pastry. When the pudding is cooked, the suet melts after the pastry has had a chance to set, leaving behind holes. This structure allows the pastry to better stand up to wet fillings and gives a lighter, fluffier texture.\n\nCultural references\nIn George Orwell's 1947 essay \"Such, Such Were the Joys,\" recounting the miseries of his preparatory school education, St Cyprian's School saves money by serving distasteful unsweetened suet pudding as a first course  to \"break the boys' appetites.\"In his 1941 essay \"England Your England\" he has a more benign view of it:\n\nIn left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings.\n\nSee also\nEnglish cuisine\nList of steamed foods\n\n\n== References ==",

The traditional recipe calls for dough made of flour mixed with lard (or butter), rolled into balls the size of walnuts, that is baked without the use of a leavening agent. The biscuits are then coated in coarse-grain sugar. Some modern recipes optionally use lemon zest or vanilla, or incorporate ground almonds and glac\u00e9 cherries. Because of the simplicity of recipe, variations exists throughout Portugal.\nAreias do Sorraia (lit.\u2009'areias from Sorraia River') are similar to areias de Cascais but made extensively with lard and dusted with cinnamon. Cinnamon brought back from Asia was a product of Portuguese Exploration in 16th century resulting its incorporation into Portuguese cuisine.Areias de Sintra (lit.\u2009'areias from Sintra') are described similar to Russian tea cakes, using hazelnuts common to the area. The biscuits are also coated in powdered sugar after baking.Areias de gengibre (lit.\u2009'ginger areias') a recipe by Nestl\u00e9, adds fresh ground ginger and lemon zest.

Unlike other areias which are formed like cookie dough, this cake is made with a batter that are baked into small individual molds. After baking, the cakes topped with sanding sugar.The original unnamed cake recipe is believed to be derived from a conventual sweet created in Lisbon. When the over two-century year old cake recipe was taken out from the convent to Lourinh\u00e3, it was named after the nearby beach Praia da Areia Branca. This traditional product is now a trademarked product made solely by a single family bakery, Casa das Areias Brancas. In recent years, the bakery has also incorporated aguardente as an ingredient.In 2016, it was featured at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in a video entitled \"The Most Famous Unknown Cake\".\n\nSee also\nConventual sweets\nPortuguese cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Her recipe is for a boiled pudding that she calls a \"cream almong pudding\", with eggs, nutmeg and cream. The pudding is boiled in cloth and served with melted butter and sugar.\n\nBritish cuisine\nIpswich almond pudding is a recipe that appears in the 18th century cookbook The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse. It's a sort of bread pudding thickened with blanched almonds and baked in puff pastry. Elizabeth Moxon also uses balanced almonds to thicken bread pudding, that can be made with butter, suet or marrow and baked in \"little tins\". In one version of the pudding Moxon omits rose water and orange flower water, adding cinnamon and a little lemon peel instead. A sauce can be made for the pudding with wine and sugar.A recipe for egg and cream custard thickened with ground almonds baked in a bain-marie is called \"English almond pudding\" by Auguste Escoffier.\n\nIndia\nIn Indian cuisine almond pudding is called badam kheer.

One recipe using isinglass also calls for crumbled amaretto cookies, chocolate and other flavorings.  One contemporary French recipe for \"bavarois\" is a savory preparation with a neufch\u00e2tel-type cheese and leeks, and is not a sweet dessert.\n\nHistory\nBavarian cream is a classic dessert that was included in the repertoire of chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, who is sometimes credited with it. It was named in the early 19th century for Bavaria or, perhaps in the  history of haute cuisine, for a particularly distinguished visiting Bavarian, such as a Wittelsbach, given that its origin is believed to have been during the 17th and 18th century when French chefs cooked for the Wittelsbach princes, a German family that ruled Bavaria from the 12th century until 1918.In the United States, Bavarian creams first appeared in Boston Cooking School books by D. A. Lincoln in 1884, and by Fannie Farmer in 1896.  From 1884 to 2022, there were over 95,000 references to Bavarian cream in US and Canadian newspapers, featuring recipes, commentaries and reviews.  Of those references, over 14,000 were in the 1930s, which seems to have been the peak decade of popularity.  Most references  were in the states of New York, Pennsylvania and California (7000-8000 each), while the fewest were in Alaska and Guam (fewer than 50 each).\n\nPreparation and serving\nBavarian cream is lightened with whipped cream when on the edge of setting up and before it is molded; a true bavarian cream is usually filled into a fluted mold, chilled until firm, then turned out onto a serving plate. By coating a chilled mold first with a fruit gelatin, a glazed effect can be produced. Imperfections in the unmolding are disguised with strategically placed fluted piping of whipped cream.  In the United States, it is common to serve Bavarian Cream directly from the bowl it has been chilled in, similar to a French mousse.   In this informal presentation, Escoffier recommended the bavarian cream be made in a \"timbale or deep silver dish which is then surrounded with crushed ice\".It may be served with a fruit sauce or a raspberry or apricot pur\u00e9e or used to fill elaborate charlottes.\nThough it does not pipe smoothly because of its gelatin, it could substitute for pastry cream as a filling for doughnuts. Some American \"Bavarian Cream doughnuts\" are filled with a version of a cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re (pastry cream), some are filled with true bavarois. The \"Bavarian Cream\" part of the name refers to the type of doughnut filling, with doughnuts including chocolate-frosted and non-chocolate-frosted varieties. Spellings of \"cream\" may differ, such as the Bavarian Cr\u00e8me Bismark from Seattle-based Top Pot Doughnuts.\nSuch was the popularity of Bavarian Cream in the 1920s that a soda/pop company in Iowa, Hur-Mon of Cedar Rapids, published a Bavarian Cream recipe calling only for whipped cream, whipped gelatin and ginger ale.  This cold preparation eliminated the need for cooking the more typical egg-based custard commonly found in recipes requiring more complex skills.\n\nGallery\nSome Bavarian cream preparations include the following.\n\nSee also\nList of custard desserts, mostly using eggs and not gelatin\nPanna cotta, made with gelatine but not eggs or whipped cream\nList of German desserts\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nFrench cremes @ The Food Timeline",

        "body": "A Boston cream pie is a cake with a cream filling. The dessert acquired its name when cakes and pies were cooked in the same pans, and the words were used interchangeably. In the late 19th century, this type of cake was variously called a \"cream pie\", a \"chocolate cream pie\", or a \"custard cake\".\n\nHistory\nIt is said to have been created in 1856 by Armenian-French chef Mossburg Sanzian at the Parker House Hotel in Boston. A direct descendant of earlier cakes known as American pudding-cake pie and Washington pie, the dessert was referred to as chocolate cream pie, Parker House chocolate cream pie, and finally Boston cream pie on Parker House's menus.  The cake consisted of two layers of French butter sponge cake filled with thick custard and brushed with a rum syrup; its side was coated with the same custard overlaid with toasted sliced almonds, and the top coated with chocolate fondant. While other custard cakes may have existed at that time, baking chocolate as a coating was a new process, making it unique and a popular choice on the menu.The name \"chocolate cream pie\" first appeared in the 1872 Methodist Almanac.  An early printed use of the term \"Boston cream pie\" occurred in the Granite Iron Ware Cook Book, printed in 1878. The earliest known recipe for the modern variant was printed in Miss Parloa's Kitchen Companion in 1887 as \"chocolate cream pie\".Boston cream pie is the official dessert of Massachusetts, declared as such on December 12, 1996.\n\nVariations\nA Boston cream doughnut is a Berliner filled with vanilla custard or cr\u00e8me p\u00e2tissi\u00e8re and topped with icing made from chocolate.The Taiwanese version of the Boston cream pie is a chiffon cake which does not include chocolate.\n\nSee also\nList of American desserts\nList of cakes\nList of regional dishes of the United States\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nStradley, Linda. \"Boston Cream Pie Recipe and History\".

        "body": "Maple custard pie is a custard pie from the cuisine of New England. Maple custard pies are sweetened only with maple sugar. Each year in New England maple sugar is made with the sap collected from local trees, a New England tradition dating to the 18th-century boycott of sugar imports from the West Indies. Because sugar from the West Indies was produced with slave labor, the maple pie is recognized as a symbol of New England's values of self-sufficiency and economic independence. The tradition of making maple pies continues into the present day but is not as common as it once was.\n\nHistory\nIn anti-slavery New England William Fox and others advocated for the boycott of sugar from the West Indies to pressure slaveholders. Maple sugar became a substitute for cane sugar, first advanced by Benjamin Rush who published a tract on sugar maples in 1788, and soon after founded the Society for Promoting the Manufacture of Sugar from the Sugar Maple Tree.Thomas Jefferson took up the cause, vowing to use \"no other sugar in his family than that which is obtained from the sugar maple tree.\" He obtained 50 pounds of maple sugar from writing in 1790 to Benjamin Vaughan that high quality sugar would be obtained from local maples with \"no other labor than what the women and girls can bestow ... What a blessing to substitute sugar which requires only the labour of children, for that which it is said renders the slavery of the blacks necessary,\" but Jefferson's maple grove did not take to the Virginia climate and all the trees died. The tradition of making maple pie, although not as common as it used to be, continues to symbolize New England values of a simple lifestyle and economic independence.\n\nPreparation\nA 1939 recipe for maple cream pie is made with maple sugar and scalded milk in a double boiler. Cornstarch is added to the sweetened milk to make a thin paste which is poured over beaten eggs, then cooked all together for one minute. Butter, vanilla and salt are stirred in. The maple custard is cooled and poured into the pie shell, served topped with whipped cream. Some versions are baked in the oven.\n\nSee also\nSugar cream pie\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Clafoutis (French pronunciation: [klafuti]; Occitan: clafot\u00eds [klafu\u02c8tis] or [k\u028eafu\u02c8ti\u02d0]), sometimes spelled clafouti in  Anglophone countries, is a French dish of fruit, traditionally unpitted black cherries, arranged in a buttered dish, covered with a thick but pourable batter, then baked to create a crustless tart. The clafoutis is traditionally dusted with powdered sugar and served lukewarm, sometimes with cream, as a dessert. It can also be served as a breakfast or brunch main or side.\n\nEtymology\nOne reported derivation of dish's name is from Occitan clafot\u00eds, from the verb clafir, meaning \"to fill\" (implied: \"the batter with cherries\"). Another reported derivation is that clafir comes from old French claufir, meaning \"to fix with nails,\" explained as the cherries having the appearance of nail heads.\n\nCyanide\nA traditional Limousin clafoutis contains both the flesh of the cherries and the nut-like kernels. Cherry kernels contain benzaldehyde, the compound responsible for the dominant flavour in almond extract. They also contain a small amount of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside - a compound potentially capable of releasing cyanide if consumed,  but non-toxic in small quantities.\n\nOrigins\nClafoutis comes from the Limousin region of France.\n\nVariations and similar dishes\nWhile unpitted black cherries are traditional, there are numerous variations using other fruits, including pitted red or black cherries, other stonefruit such as peaches or plums, other fruit such as apples or pears, or berries.A flaugnarde is a dessert similar to clafoutis, made with other kinds of fruit such as apples, pears, apricots or plums. Cacou, a specialty of Paray-le-Monial, is a dessert similar to clafoutis made with unpitted Bigarreaux cherries. Far Breton is a dessert similar to clafoutis made with prunes. A flan is a similar dish made with a flourless batter.Savory clafoutis, made with vegetables and without sugar, can also be made.\n\nIngredients, preparation and serving\nA pourable batter, similar in thickness to a pancake batter, is made from flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and salt and sometimes other ingredients such as almond flour, yogurt, and flavorings such as vanilla or kirsch or other fruit brandies. The batter is poured over cherries or other fruit in a shallow baking dish and baked. Some recipes call for pouring the batter into the pan and topping with the fruit before baking. The finished product has a light, custardlike texture.The dish is traditionally served as a dessert, but some less-sweet variations may also be appropriate as a breakfast or brunch dish. It can be served warm, at room temperature, or chilled. It may be served sprinkled with powdered sugar and may be served alone or with accompaniments such as cream, whipped cream, or ice cream.\n\nCultural references\nIn her autobiographical novel The War: A Memoir, French resister and writer Marguerite Duras carefully gathers up the rationed ingredients to make her husband a clafoutis when he returns from the concentration camps, only to find that he is too weak from malnutrition and exposure to eat it.\n\nSee also\nList of French dishes\nList of French desserts\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Crema catalana 'Catalan cream' or crema cremada 'burnt cream' is a Catalan and Spanish dessert consisting of a custard topped with a layer of caramelized sugar. It is \"virtually identical\" to the French cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Like all custards, it is made from milk, egg yolks, and sugar. Some modern recipes add cornflour. It is typically flavored with lemon zest, cinnamon, or vanilla, and a crisp caramel crust is made by caramelizing sugar placed on top of the custard.\n\nRecipe\nCrema catalana and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e are made in the same way, although some cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e recipes enrich the milk with cream, or substitute cream for the milk. Unlike cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, crema catalana is invariably flavoured with cinnamon and lemon zest. Modern versions are often thickened with cornflour.Crema catalana cannot be frozen successfully.\n\nHistory\nLa Vanguardia reported that \"precursor versions\" of crema catalana appear in early Catalan cookbooks, mentioning custards which were not burnt on top in the 14th century Llibre de Sent Sov\u00ed and in the 16th century Llibre del Coch.Analogous recipes appear in 18th century Spanish cookery books, usually under the name of Cream of Saint Joseph (\"Crema de Sant Josep\"), since it was a traditional dessert served during Saint Joseph's Day, although nowadays it is consumed at all times of the year. The recipe was first referred to as crema catalana (Catalan cream) in the 1745 cookbook by the Spanish friar Juan de Altamiras, where the recipe was said to be of Catalan origin. The burnt sugar topping is first documented in 1770.\n\nSee also\nMat\u00f3 de Pedralbes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHow to make crema catalana (video)\nCrema catalana Recipe",

        "body": "A custard pie is any type of uncooked custard mixture placed in an uncooked or partially cooked crust and baked together.  In North America, \"custard pie\" commonly refers to a plain mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla extract and sometimes nutmeg combined with a pie crust. It is distinctly different from a cream pie, which contains cooked custard poured into a cooled, precooked crust. In the United Kingdom, the comical or political act of pieing is conventionally done with a  \"custard pie\".  Some common custard pies include pumpkin pie, lemon and buttermilk chess pie, coconut cream pie, and buko pie. True custard is defined as a liquid thickened with eggs. The often large number of whole eggs in custard pie make it very rich.\nCooks in Classical antiquity understood the binding properties of eggs.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the first custard pies - in the modern sense of the term - began to appear. Initially, custards were used only as fillings for pies, pastries and tarts. Both Europe and Asia had recipes that contained custards.\nThe word \"custard\" derives from crustade (a pie with a crust),\nor from  croustade (an edible container of savoury food). After the 16th century, custards began to be used in individual dishes rather than as a filling in crusts.Today, custards are used as filling in pies and tarts, and as individual dishes. Ideally a custard pie should be light and delicate, but still have good body. Custards can be made in two ways: baked or stirred upon the stove, but most custard-pie recipes call for baking. The eggs in custard mixtures, when cooked, turn from liquid to solid. If cooked over excessive heat, the eggs will curdle, which is extremely undesirable. Curdling can be prevented by using lower temperatures and stirring. As such, making \"true\" custard pie is a very delicate process.\n\nHistory\nSavory pies with meat fillings were far more common than sweet pies in the Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies. Sweet pies, when they were available, were made with a simple custard base of fresh milk, sugar and eggs. Some of these traditional pies like buttermilk pie, almond custard, Irish potato pie and bean pie (associated with the Nation of Islam) are uncommon in modern times.\n\nAs a comedic device\nIn British English, pies thrown or pushed into the face are usually referred to as \"custard pies\".  Custard pies are used as a comedic device by clowns in many circus performances,  in practical jokes for harmless fun and also for throwing into the faces of public figures as a sign of disapproval. UK Saturday morning programme Tiswas had custard pies as a regular feature and even had a character called The Phantom Flan Flinger, a masked man who pied people. The World Custard Pie Throwing Championships take place annually in the village of Coxheath in Kent, England.\n\nSee also\nBougatsa\nCoconut pie\nChess pie\nCream pie\nEgg pie\nList of custard desserts\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Double skin milk (Chinese: \u96d9\u76ae\u5976; Jyutping: soeng1 pei4 naai5) is a Chinese dessert made of milk, egg whites, and sugar. It originated from Shunde, Guangdong. It is a velvety smooth milk custard somewhat resembling panna cotta, with two skins. The first skin is formed during cooling of the boiled milk and the second when cooling the cooked custard. Traditionally, buffalo milk is used; its higher fat content compared to cow's milk produces a smooth texture. The usage of milk from the swamp buffalo in China is unusual because of the low yield of milk as compared with that of cows and river buffalo used in the rest of the world. This dessert is particularly popular in Shunde, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Macau, and Hong Kong.\n\nHistory\nDouble skin milk originated in the Daliang, Shunde in Guangdong. It is said to have been created by Grandma Dong in Qing Dynasty in Shunde. At that time, there was no refrigeration and the temperature was always high in Guangdong. Cowherd Grandma Dong found difficulties in storing milk. In one experiment, she boiled the milk and found a skin formed on the milk after cooling it down. The skin was surprisingly delicious. Hence, she started to sell milk with skin in her store and the products became popular in the neighborhood. However, milk with skin tended to spill easily during transportation. To solve this problem, Grandma Dong added egg white to the milk, which allowed the milk to curdle after boiling. After several improvements, contemporary double skin milk developed, with Grandma Dong credited as the originator. Nowadays, the skills used in making double skin milk are listed as part of Shunde's intangible cultural heritage.The double skin milk has kept its popularity for a long time under such a competitive market for traditional food in China. Under the impact of fashion trends, the traditional double skin milk is constantly innovated while its traditional essence is retained. According to Grandma Dong, the exhibition they built has not only popularized not only the culture and origin of double skin milk, but also its amazing flavor.\n\nNutritive value\nDouble skin milk is rich in protein, which balances potassium sodium, eliminates edema, boosts immunity, lowers blood pressure, buffers anemia, and is conducive to growth.\nDouble skin milk is rich in calcium, which is helpful to bone development. It helps human bodies to regulate enzyme activity, which allows bodies to participate in nerve activity, muscle activity, and neurotransmitter release. It also helps human bodies to regulate hormone secretion and heart rate. It also reduces cardiovascular permeability, eliminates inflammation and edema, and balances acid-base in human bodies.\nDouble skin milk is rich in lactose, which makes calcium easily absorbed by the body.\n\nDocumentary clip\nDouble-skin milk has been included in the documentary, A Bite of Shunde, in its 2nd episode. A Bite of Shunde is a cuisine documentary, filmed by the direction team of A Bite of China in 2016. It records numerous famous and delicious dishes in Shunde. In the 2nd episode of A Bite of Shunde, at 00:7:00-00:08:11, the documentary reveals the recipes and cooking process of this dessert, and grants the title of \u201cProud of Shunde.\n\nAward\nProvincial Intangible Cultural Heritage Authentic Double Skin Milk (2018)\nRegional Intangible Cultural Heritage Authentic Double Skin Milk (2013\uff09\nGuangdong Time-Honored Brand (2018\uff09\nGuangdong Lingnan Special Cuisine (2010)\nFoshan Dishes\nThe most distinctive local food award\nThe 7th Oscar Cate Peagant nominations\nFoshan Top Ten Snacks\nPhoenix City Sign Dim sum\n\nDevelopment and Inheritance\nDouble skin milk and milk tea\nIn 2022 March, the fourth generation inheritor of Minxin, Zhanzhong Liang launched the newest product of double skin milk, Double Skin Milk Milk Tea.

        "body": "Eierschecke is a confectionery speciality from Saxony and Thuringia.\nIt is a layer cake with a base layer of cake, a middle layer of quark-based cheesecake and a top layer of vanilla custard. Parts of it are covered with a glaze made of cream, whole egg, sugar and flour for thickening. The term originates from a piece of 14th century menswear called Schecke which consisted of a medium-length tunic with a very tight waistline and was worn with a Dusing, a hip belt. The cake was named after the appearance of this \"tripartite garment\" (upper part, belt, lower part).\n\nPreparation\nAs the name is derived from a tripartite piece of clothing, Eierschecke consists of three parts or layers: the upper layer is made of creamy stirred egg yolk with butter, sugar, vanilla pudding and, lastly, beaten egg whites, which are folded into the batter. The middle layer (the \"belt\") consists of a kind of custard which, in addition to butter, egg, sugar and milk, also contains quark and vanilla flavouring. The cake base is either a yeast dough or shortcrust pastry. After these three layers are assembled, the cake is baked, then cut into rectangular pieces and served with coffee. \nWhile the recipe above is for the traditional Eierschecke from Dresden, there are also some variations and refinements of this recipe, e.g. the addition of raisins, almonds or Streusel, or even the coating of the whole cake with chocolate.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAnother variation is the Freiberger Eierschecke, which is much less tall than the Dresdner Eierschecke and contains neither quark nor raisins. Legend states that the quark had been used to build the city wall of Freiberg in the 13th century. To compensate for the alleged loss of flavour, more egg, sugar and even raisins were used. The legend is deliberately nonsensical: dairy products like quark have no history of being used in mortar (unlike sticky rice mortar).\n\nPopular culture\nThe German author Erich K\u00e4stner once said: \"Die Eierschecke ist eine Kuchensorte, die zum Schaden der Menschheit auf dem Rest des Globus unbekannt geblieben ist.\" (The Eierschecke is a type of cake which, to the detriment of humanity, has remained unknown to the rest of the world), and Martin Walser says in his book Die Verteidigung der Kindheit (The defence of childhood): \"Eierschecke gibt es au\u00dferhalb Sachsens nur ersatzweise und innerhalb Sachsens nirgends so gut wie im Toscana.\" (There are only substitutes of Eierschecke outside of Saxony; within Saxony, there is no better Eierschecke than at the Toscana (referring to the Caf\u00e9 Toscana in Dresden))\n\nSee also\nList of cakes\n\nReferences\nIREKS-Arkady-Institut f\u00fcr B\u00e4ckereiwissenschaft (Hrsg.): IREKS-ABC der B\u00e4ckerei. 4.

        "body": "Frozen custard is a frozen dessert that is a type of ice cream that is made with egg yolks in addition to cream and sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and an additional flavoring such as cocoa, vanilla, or fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It is usually kept at a warmer temperature compared to ice cream, and typically has a denser consistency.\n\nHistory\nEgg yolks have been integrated into ice creams since at least the 1690s, though there are several notable invention stories that are associated with modern commercializations of this practice.\nOne early commercialization of frozen custard was in Coney Island, New York, in 1919, when ice cream vendors Archie and Elton Kohr found that adding egg yolks to ice cream created a smoother texture and helped the ice cream stay cold longer. In their first weekend on the boardwalk, they sold 18,460 cones.Throughout the 1920s, the popularity of frozen custard spread from Coney Island to traveling carnivals. That is where tennis player Theodore R. Drewes Sr. was introduced to the treat when he began selling it in Florida to earn extra money during the winter off-season, first with the traveling carnival in the 1920s and then at his own custard stand in 1929. He brought the business back to his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, where he opened Ted Drewes in 1930 and expanded to a second location in 1931 and three stores in that city by 1941. Ted Drewes is often credited as the birthplace of the concrete, which is a thick custard churned with mix-ins. Ted Drewes custard shop in the Dutchtown neighborhood is the oldest frozen custard stand in the world that's still in operation.A frozen custard stand at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago introduced the dessert to a wider audience. Following the fair, the dessert's popularity spread throughout the Midwest; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in particular, became known as the \"unofficial frozen custard capital of the world\".Per capita, Milwaukee has the highest concentration of frozen custard shops in the world and the city supports a long-standing three-way competition between Kopp's Frozen Custard, Gilles Frozen Custard and Leon's Frozen Custard.\nMajor frozen custard chains in the United States include Culver's, headquartered in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, with outlets in 26 states; Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers, based in Wichita, Kansas, with more than 300 locations nationwide; and Andy's Frozen Custard, based in Springfield, Missouri, with over 140 locations in 15 states. Other chains serving frozen custard include Ted Drewes (based in Saint Louis, Missouri), Rita's Italian Ice (a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), The Meadows, and Abbott's (Rochester, New York).\n\nCharacteristics\nIn the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration requires any product marketed as frozen custard to contain at least 10 percent milkfat and 1.4 percent egg yolk solids. The FDA also allows the names \u201cfrench ice cream\u201d or \u201cfrench custard ice cream\u201d to be used. If it has a smaller percentage of egg yolk solids, it is considered ice cream and legally classified as such by the FDA.Actual frozen custard is a very dense dessert.  Soft serve ice creams may have an overrun as large as 100%, meaning half of the final product is composed of air. Frozen custard, when made in a continuous freezer, will have an overrun of 15\u201330% depending on the machine manufacturer (an overrun percentage similar to gelato). Air is not pumped into the mix, nor is it added as an \"ingredient\" but gets into the frozen state by the agitation of liquid similar to whisking a meringue. The high percentage of butterfat and egg yolk gives the frozen custard a thick, creamy texture and a smoother consistency than ice cream.  Frozen custard can be served at \u22128 \u00b0C (18 \u00b0F), warmer than the \u221212 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0F) at which ice cream is served, to make a soft serve product.\nAnother difference between commercially produced frozen custard and commercial ice cream is the way the custard is frozen. The mix enters a refrigerated tube and, as it freezes, blades scrape the product cream off the barrel walls. The now frozen custard is discharged directly into containers from which it can be served. The speed with which the product leaves the barrel minimizes the amount of air in the product but, more importantly, ensures that the ice crystals formed are very small.\n\nSee also\nCustard, the basic egg and dairy preparations\nFrozen yogurt, the cultured and frozen milk product\nGelato, the Italian style of ice cream\nIce cream\nList of custard desserts\nList of frozen custard companies\nSemifreddo, the partially frozen type of dessert, sometimes a custard mixed with whipped cream\nSoft serve, a soft form of ice cream\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFDA Standards for Frozen Desserts",

        "body": "A neenish tart (or neenish cake) is a tart made with a pastry base and a filling  consisting of sweet gelatine-set cream, mock cream, icing sugar paste, or lemon and sweetened condensed milk mixture, with dried icing on the top of the tart in two colours. The addition of a layer of raspberry jam is a common recipe variation. The colours used for the icing are usually some combination of brown, white, and pink. They are almost exclusively sized as individual servings,  60\u201380  mm in diameter. The tart was originally created in Australia and is mainly found there, alongside New Zealand and the Falkland Islands.The origin of the name \"neenish\" is unknown. A column in the Sydney Morning Herald attributed the name to a woman named Ruby Neenish, but this was later revealed to be a prank. Alternative names such as nenische (recorded in 1929) and nienich (recorded in 1935) suggest a German origin, although neenish was known before the alternatives, suggesting these names were to give a \"continental\" flavour to the tart.\"Nenish cakes\" appear in Sydney newspaper advertisements as early as 1895, and a reference to neenish tarts is found in a recipe in the Sydney Mail in November 1901. A recipe published in Launceston's Daily Telegraph in January 1903 is very similar. Both recipes used an almond-based pastry and a filling comprising a \"very thick custard of eggs and milk thickened with cornflour\". The top of the tart consisted of coffee and vanilla icing in equal halves. Another early printed recipe was in Miss Drake's Home Cookery published in 1929, calling for cream filling set with gelatine and pink christabelle and white icing on top. A 1932 recipe in Miranda's Cook Book calls for custard filling and chocolate and white icing.The lemon-flavoured version of the tart most familiar to New Zealand residents is found in the Edmonds Cookery Book. It includes a filling made from butter, icing sugar, sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice, set in a sweet short pastry crust and topped with half standard white icing and half chocolate (cocoa added) icing.In Australia the term pineapple tart often refers to a variation on the Neenish Tart, with pineapple jam below the filling, and passionfruit icing.\n\nSee also\nBlack and white cookie\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "P\u0105czki (Polish: [\u02c8p\u0254nt\u0361\u0282k\u02b2i] ; sg.: p\u0105czek, Polish: [\u02c8p\u0254nt\u0361\u0282\u025bk]; Kashubian: p\u00f9rcle; Old Polish and Silesian: kreple) are filled doughnuts found in Polish cuisine.\n\nDescription\nA p\u0105czek is a deep-fried piece of dough shaped into a flattened ball and filled with confiture or other sweet filling. P\u0105czki are usually covered with powdered sugar, icing, glaze, or bits of dried orange zest. A small amount of grain alcohol (traditionally rectified spirit) is added to the dough before cooking; as it evaporates, it prevents the absorption of oil deep into the dough. P\u0105czki are commonly thought of as fluffy but somewhat collapsed, with a bright stripe around them; these features are seen as evidence that the dough was fried in fresh oil.Although they look like German berliners (bismarcks in North America) or jelly doughnuts, p\u0105czki are made from especially rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast, and sometimes milk. They feature a variety of fruit and creme fillings and can be glazed, or covered with granulated or powdered sugar. Powid\u0142a (stewed plum jam) and wild rose petal jam are traditional fillings, but many others are used as well, including strawberry, Bavarian cream, blueberry, custard, raspberry, and apple.P\u0105czki have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. J\u0119drzej Kitowicz wrote that during the reign of Augustus III, under the influence of French cooks who came to Poland, p\u0105czki dough was improved so that p\u0105czki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.\n\nEtymology, spelling, and pronunciation\nThe Polish word p\u0105czek [\u02c8p\u0254nt\u0361\u0282\u025bk] (plural: p\u0105czki [\u02c8p\u0254nt\u0361\u0282k\u02b2i]) is a diminutive of the Polish word p\u0105k [\u02c8p\u0254\u014bk] \"bud\". The latter derives from Proto-Slavic *p\u01ebk\u044a, which may have referred to anything that is round, bulging and about to burst (compare Proto-Slavic *p\u01ebkti \"to swell, burst\"), possibly of ultimately onomatopoeic origin. From Polish the word has been borrowed into several other Slavic languages, where the respective loanwords (ponchik, ponchyk or ponichka) refer to a similar ball-shaped pastry.English speakers typically use the plural form of the Polish word in both singular and plural. They pronounce it as  and often write it as \"paczki\", i.e., without the ogonek (hook-shaped diacritic). This should not be confused with the unrelated Polish word paczki [\u02c8pat\u0361\u0282k\u02b2i], which is the plural form of paczka [\u02c8pat\u0361\u0282ka], meaning \"package\" or \"parcel\".\n\nP\u0105czki Day\nIn Poland, p\u0105czki are eaten especially on Fat Thursday (T\u0142usty Czwartek), the last Thursday prior to Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent. The traditional reason for making p\u0105czki was to use up all the lard, sugar, eggs and fruit in the house, because their consumption was forbidden by Christian fasting practices during the season of Lent.In North America, particularly the large Polish communities of Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, and other large cities across the Midwest and Northeast, Paczki Day is celebrated annually by immigrants and locals alike. The date of this observance merges with that of pre-Lenten traditions of other immigrants (e.g., Pancake Day, Mardi Gras) on Fat Tuesday. With its sizable Polish population, Chicago celebrates the festival on both Fat Thursday and Fat Tuesday. P\u0105czki are also often eaten on Casimir Pulaski Day. In Buffalo, Toledo, Cleveland, Detroit, Grand Rapids, St. Louis, South Bend, Louisville, and Windsor, P\u0105czki Day is celebrated on Fat Tuesday.The P\u0105czki Day celebrations in some areas are even larger than many celebrations for St. Patrick's Day. In Hamtramck, Michigan, an enclave of Detroit, there is an annual P\u0105czki Day (Shrove Tuesday) Parade, which has gained a devoted following. Throughout the Metro Detroit area, it is so widespread that many bakeries attract lines of customers for p\u0105czki on P\u0105czki Day. In suburban Cleveland, Eastern European bakery Rudy's Strudel hosts a large indoor and outdoor Paczki Day party in conjunction with neighboring record store, The Current Year. It is called \"the Mardi Gras of the Midwest\".In some areas, P\u0105czki Day is celebrated with p\u0105czki-eating contests.\n\nUnited States\nThese pastries have become popular in the United States as a result of Polish immigrants and marketing by the bakery industry. Sold in bakeries mainly on both Fat Tuesday and Fat Thursday throughout Detroit and Chicago, they are particularly popular in areas where there is a large concentration of Polish immigrants: Milwaukee, Northcentral and Southeastern Wisconsin, Chicago, Northern Illinois, Northwest Indiana, Metro Detroit, Greater Grand Rapids, Mid Michigan, Greater Buffalo, New York, Greater Rochester, New York, Toledo, Greater Cincinnati, Greater Cleveland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Northern and Central New Jersey, Central Connecticut, and Western Massachusetts.\n\nSee also\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of Polish desserts\n\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nGeneral and cited sources\nExternal links\nPaczki Day PSA, an account of Detroit area Paczki Day traditions in 2008\nPaczkis Video produced by Wisconsin Public Television",

The pecan shortbread crust is different from other icebox pies.The first mention of Possum Pie in the Arkansas Gazette dates to a 1983 restaurant review. The recipe itself doesn't begin to appear in food sections until the late 2000s. An earlier recipe for a layered nut-crumb crust pudding and cream cheese pie with whipped topping was submitted to the Arkansas Dairy Recipe Contest, a student content open to fourth-12th graders. Similar recipes for a pie called \"The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford\" were being published  by the Indianapolis Star and Los Angeles Times by 1982.

It was usually put in school lunches as a dessert or sold at bake sales, hence the name.In Arctic Norway, a similar roll without icing and coconut (known as a solbolle) is eaten to celebrate the return of the sun after polar night.\n\nHistory\nThis type of pastry appeared in the 1950s.\nIn the 1970s, controversy arose over the pastry's name. When the discussion about children and young people eating too much sugar and sweets came up, there were several people who advocated that calling a high-calorie bun \"bread\" could contribute to it becoming something people ate on a daily basis. Skolebolle therefore became a new word that decade.In 2017, the Information Office for Bread and Grain took the initiative to introduce a separate \"School Bread Day\". This day has been added to the last Friday before the school's summer holidays.Norwegians are also divided on the question of how to eat a school bread. According to a survey carried out by the Information Office for Bread and Grain in 2021, 50% of Norwegians eat the school bread crosswise like a regular bowl. 47% eat their way around and save the yellow for the end.\n\nSee also\nList of custard desserts\nList of Norwegian desserts\nList of sweet breads\n\nCitations\nExternal links\n Media related to Skolebr\u00f8d at Wikimedia Commons\nRecipe",

The word vlaai is related and has since come to refer to a type of pie.Traditionally vla is made with eggs, sugar and fresh milk, although some industrial producers use cornstarch rather than eggs today. Vla is available in many different flavors, of which vanilla is most popular. Other flavors include chocolate, caramel, banana, orange and apple.Vla was originally sold in glass bottles and the consistency made extracting the complete amount difficult, so a special bottle scraper (flessenschraper or flessenlikker) was specifically designed. Despite the fact that vla is now normally sold in cartons, these scrapers are still common in Dutch family kitchens.\nAlthough vla is originally a typical Dutch product, it was introduced to Wallonia and Germany by Campina in 2010 and has been sold in some stores there since then. It is also sold in Britain, though it is just called custard and is exclusively sold in tubs instead of cartons.\n\nSee also\nList of custard desserts\n\n\n== References ==",

The name, watalappam, could be a corruption of the Tamil words vattil (cup) and appam (cake), hence vatillappam (cup cake). The dish however was originally unknown to the Tamil population. It is more likely that the dessert is derived from a Malay dish known as serikaya, which is a steamed custard made from eggs, coconut milk, palm sugar and pandan or screwpine leaves. The similarity between the two dishes suggests a common origin. It is likely that it is a word borrowed from the Dutch, Vla, which means a custard, and was applied by the Moors as a vernacular name, vattil-appan, using the Tamil phrasing.The dessert has come to be strongly identified with Sri Lanka's Muslim community and is a part of a traditional Eid al-Fitr celebrations, marking the end of Ramadan. It is also popular during weddings, religious festivals and other social functions and celebrations.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Sri Lanka\nList of custard desserts\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWatalappam Recipe",

        "body": "Jolpan (Assamese: \u099c\u09b2\u09aa\u09be\u09a8), or snacks, are often served at breakfast in the cuisine of Assam, although they may also be served at Bihu festivals or weddings. The word jolpan includes all the preparations namely jolpan, pitha, laru and tea. Other common items served for breakfast may include roti, luchi, ghugni and sometimes paratha etc. Jolpan are also found in Bengal. The word literally derives from \"water and betel leaf\" but can mean any snack.\n\nTypes of Jolpan\nVariations on jolpan include Bora saul, Komal Saul, Xandoh, Chira, Muri, Akhoi along with curd, jaggery, yogurt and various Pitha.\n\nBora saul\nBora saul (Assamese: \u09ac\u09f0\u09be \u099a\u09be\u0989\u09b2) is boiled and served as Jolpan with curd or milk, jaggery or sugar. Mostly used in Northern Assam.\n\nKomal Saul\nKumol saul (Assamese: \u0995\u09cb\u09ae\u09b2 \u099a\u09be\u0989\u09b2) is a unique type of rice from Assam that can be eaten without cooking. It is rendered fluffy and edible by being soaked in water for a short time. The rice may be eaten with milk or curd, jaggery, yogurt after being immersed in warm water for just fifteen minutes or so.\n\nChira\nChira (Flattened rice, also called beaten rice, Assamese: \u099a\u09bf\u09f0\u09be) is a dehusked rice which is flattened into flat light dry flakes. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. It can be eaten raw by immersing it in plain water or milk or curd, with salt or sugar or jaggery to taste, or lightly fried in oil.\n\nMuri\nMuri (puffed rice) is made by heating sand in a pot, and then throwing in grains of rice. The rice may be washed in brine to provide seasoning. The rice puffs up and is separated from the sand by a strainer. It is served with hot milk or curd and jaggery or sugar.\n\nXandoh Guri\n(Assamese: \u09b8\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09b9 \u0997\u09c1\u09f0\u09bf) It is prepared from Kola bora, Ghiu bora, Pakhi bora or Ronga bora (varieties of Bora saul). The rice is soaked for three to four days and then it is fried. The fried rice is pounded in a dheki, a homemade wooden mill in Assam to pound grains, and sifted to dehusk. Now the pounded and dehusked rice is again fried in hot sand and thus Hurum is prepared. It is served with curd, hot milk, yogurt, sugar or jaggery.\n\nSunga Saul\nDehusked Aroi bora saul is soaked for 2/3 hours. Then it is put in an immature bamboo tube and a little water or sometimes coconut milk is added to it. Banana leaf is used as cork. The tube is roasted in fire and Sunga saul is prepared. Removing the tube the substance is served with curd, hot milk, yogurt, sugar etc.\n\nPithaguri\nRice flour (Pithaguri in Assamese) is fried and served with hot milk, jaggery and sometimes with ripe banana or ripe jackfruit. It is a common type of jolpan.\n\nSuji\nSuji (Semolina) is also one type of common jolpan, a type of dessert. Like pithaguri it is heated on a frying pan and water is added to make it a paste and then served with hot milk.\n\nKoni-dhan\nThe basic preparation consists of washing the millet (Konidhan in Assamese; Koni = tiny; dhan = rice) and toasting it while moving it until one notes a characteristic scent. Then five measures of boiling water for each two measures of millet are added with some sugar or salt. The mixture is cooked covered using low flame for 30\u201335 minutes.\n\nKath Aloo\nYam (Kath aloo in Assamese) is peeled, sliced, added salt and tamarind powder and then deep fried in mustard oil.\n\nPitha\nPitha (Assamese \u09aa\u09bf\u09a0\u09be) is a rice cake or pancake, a thin-flat cake prepared from a batter and cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan. It is an inseparable part of Jolpan in Assam. It is a special class of rice preparation generally made only on special occasions like Bihu in Assam. Made usually with soaked and ground rice, they could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate. Some pithas are- Til Pitha, Narikol Pitha, Ghila Pitha, Xutuli Pitha, Sunga Pitha, Bhapotdiya Pitha, Lakhimi Pitha, Tora Pitha, Tekeli Pitha, Muthiya Pitha or Kholasapori Pitha.\n\nKachi Pitha\nKachi Pitha is a type of pancake. It is a special class of rice preparation and generally made only on special occasions like Bihu in Assam. Bora saul, a glutinous type of rice is soaked and ground. Then a certain quantity of this rice flour is baked, filled up with sesame seeds, ground coconut and dried rind of orange, jaggery  etc. and pressed and rolled with many folders.\n\nGhila Pitha\nGhila pitha is a type of pancake so called because of its knee cap-sized shape. The knee cap is called Ghila in Assamese. Rice flour of Bora saul, one kind of glutinous rice or any common rice is used in it. A paste made of rice flour and jaggery is prepared first and then fried in cooking oil at a certain quantity. Salt is also used instead of jaggery to make salty Ghila pitha. It is generally prepared and served in Bihu in Assam.\n\nSunga Pitha\nThe procedure of preparing Sunga Pitha is almost the same as for Sunga Saul except for the fact that the preparation of sunga pitha involves grounded rice or rice flour instead of whole rice as in Sunga saul . Rice flour of Xaali saul and Bora saul is mixed with water and jaggery and churned thoroughly. Then the paste is put in an immature bamboo tube corked with banana leaf and roasted over a fire. The bamboo tube is removed to leave a solid cylinder of pitha. This is cut into pieces and served with hot milk.\n\nUhuwa Pitha\nRice flour of xaali saul and bora saul is mixed with jaggery or salt and water and churned thoroughly. The paste is rolled into small balls and flattened and then boiled in water. It is served with tea and also can be eaten with milk.\n\nTekeli Pitha\nRice flour of Xaali saul (sunned rice) and Bora saul is mixed with coconut, sugar and a little powdered milk. Ground cardamom and dried orange rind can also be added. An earthenware, half filled up with water is set on a hearth. A neat cloth is placed on the beam of the pitcher and the flour mixture is put in it. Now the beam is covered with a cork and fire is set in the hearth. The substance is baked with the heat of vapor that comes from inside the pitcher and subsequently takes shape. Now it is cut into pieces like a cake and served with tea. This pitha is so called because a tekeli (earthenware) is used in it.\n\nKetli Pitha\nThe method of preparation as well as the substance is as same as tekeli pitha, but a kettle is used here instead of the earthenware. That\u2019s the reason it is called Ketli pitha (Ketli in Assamese means kettle). Here the kettle-cork is kept upside down on the kettle and the substance is put on it. It usually takes less time to be baked than tekeli pitha takes.\n\nLaru\nDifferent types of larus are prepared in the season of Bihu in Assam.\n\nNarikolor Laru\nMature coconut is scrapped (or ground) and fried. Then sugar is added and mixed well. Then it is toasted over slow fire till the ingredients caramelize and hold on to each other. Its readiness is tested by trying to make a small ball first; if it does, then the caramelized coconut pot is taken out to cool off a little. With the help of cold water rubbed on palms, and before it cools down to room temperature, it is now rolled into small balls and kept separately to dry. These small balls of coconut are called Narikol Laru. It is served with tea.\n\nTilor laru\nTilor laru is a kind of sesame candy. Sesame seeds are fried and kept aside. Jaggery is heated to liquefy and then poured into the heap of fried sesame seeds. They get sticky and the substance is rolled into small balls and kept separately to dry. These balls are served with tea.\n\nTea\nA cup of tea is inseparable from jolpan or pitha. It is always seen with those items whenever they are served. It is served in the form of Black tea, Milk tea, Spiced tea, Lemon tea (adding lemon juice to black tea) etc. It is a hugely consumed beverage in Assam and also can be called a type of dessert.\n\nSee also\nCuisine of Assam\nList of vegetables used in Assamese cuisine\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAssameseFood.com (2009) \"Assamese Food- taste for a difference\"",

His dad was a construction worker and his mother was a seamstress.He worked as an aerial photographer in the United States Navy during the late 1950s, before returning to Brooklyn. He worked at several jobs before being hired by the Arnold Bread company as a deliveryman.Gruppuso's marriage to Virginia Pantaleo ended in divorce.\n\nKozy Shack Enterprises\nGruppuso continued to work as a bread deliveryman in Brooklyn during the 1960s. He discovered the Cozy Shack delicatessen on Seneca Avenue in Brooklyn, which happened to be one of his delivery stops. He soon began selling trays of the puddings from the Cozy Shack to his other customers on his delivery route, in addition to the bread.He bought the recipe for the puddings outright from the Cozy Shack delicatessen in 1967 and opened a small factory in Ridgewood, Queens. The small company quickly expanded into a major business. As of January 2008, Gruppuso's company has more than 400 employees working in three plants, which are located in Turlock, California, Hicksville, New York and Lough Egish, Ireland. The company estimated its total revenue at around $140 million in 2007, much of it from the sale of 115 million containers of pudding and pastries during that year. Kozy Shack puddings are sold throughout Europe, the United States, Mexico and Canada.In 2006, The New York Times named Kozy Shack's rice pudding as one of its \"Grocery Gems.\"In 2012, Kozy Shack Enterprises was sold to Land O'Lakes.\n\nDeath\nGruppuso died at his home in East Hampton, New York, on December 29, 2007, of complications from diabetes at the age of 67. He is survived by three daughters, his former wife, a brother and sister, and five grandchildren.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nKozy Shack Enterprises\nKozy Shack International",

        "body": "Hakuto jelly (\u767d\u6843\u30bc\u30ea\u30fc) is a seasonal Japanese dessert available in the summer. It is made using the juice of ripe hakuto peaches from Okayama and mineral-rich spring water. The texture is very smooth and soft, similar to the texture of the fruit itself. It has a light floral/peach aroma and taste. Hakuto jelly often comes in a container designed like the peach it was made from. Hakuto jelly can either be cut into cubes and served as such, or eaten with a spoon from the container. It is best served as a cold dish. Because it is a seasonal dessert, the taste of hakuto jelly differs slightly every year as the peaches do each season. Due to the quality of the peaches used to create it, hakuto jelly is very expensive.\n\n\n== References ==",

There are numerous variations with different composition. The dish, which is traced back to as far as Medieval Egypt, it is named after the wife of the Sultan of Egypt, who, according to folklore, asked all Egypt's cooks and women to compete and come up with the most delicious dessert that they could create as a form of celebration. The chosen recipe was later distributed throughout the country to celebrate, and it is a national dish of Egypt and a traditional Egyptian dessert till this day. It is commonly eaten during Ramadan as part of the iftar or sunset feast.\n\nHistory\nThe Egyptian dessert is said to have originated as a celebration of the death of Shajar al-Durr, who had been married to Egypt's final Sultan from the Ayyubid dynasty, As-Salih, and subsequently to the first of Egypt's Mamluk Sultans, Izz al-Din Aybak. Shajar al-Durr plotted the murder of Aybak, after which she became ruler of Egypt. Ultimately, she was herself killed in retribution, whereafter Aybak's first wife, who was known as Om Ali, asked to have a dessert prepared in celebration. The dessert was popularised throughout the country, and was named after Om Ali.\n\nRecipe\nTypically, pastry (bread, pastry or puff pastry) is divided into pieces and blended with pistachios, coconut flakes, raisins and plenty of sugar. Milk, sometimes with cream, is poured over the mixture, which is then sprinkled with cinnamon. Finally, the mixture is baked in the oven until the surface is golden brown.It may be eaten hot or cold.There are another Jordanian and Iraqi different variants known as \"khumaiaa\".The dish may be compared to bread and butter pudding, albeit that the latter also includes eggs.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is sometimes described as a steamed bun that is similar to Chinese flower rolls, with a soft and fluffy texture. It does not contain any kind of filling. A tingmo with some type of filling, like beef or chicken, is called a momo. Tingmo are often paired with vegetable dishes, meat dishes, dal dishes, and phing sha (a dish consisting of cellophane noodles, meat, and wood ear mushrooms).

        "body": "Budae-jjigae (Korean: \ubd80\ub300\ucc0c\uac1c; lit. army base stew) is a type of spicy jjigae (Korean stew) from South Korea that is made with a variety of ingredients, often canned or processed. Common ingredients include ham, sausage, Spam, baked beans, kimchi, instant noodles, gochujang and American cheese. The dish is now a popular anju (accompaniment to alcoholic drinks) and a comfort food cooked in a large pot for multiple people. It also goes by the English names army stew, army base stew, and spicy sausage stew.\nAround the time of the dish's invention, South Korea was among the poorest countries in the world, with many of its citizens relying on international aid for survival. The dish has its origins in a predecessor often called kkulkuri-juk (\uafc0\uafc0\uc774\uc8fd; lit. piggy porridge), that was created around the time of the Korean War, using food waste from or goods illegally smuggled off of United States Forces Korea bases. A prominent ingredient of the dish, Spam, was only made legally available for sale in 1987, around the time that South Korea democratized.\nAlthough the dish came from conditions of poverty, it has remained consistently popular, even during and after South Korea's rapid economic growth. Its low cost, flexibility, and simplicity have been praised. In South Korea, there are many restaurants that specialize in budae-jjigae. Gyeonggi Province's city of Uijeongbu, which claims to have first made the dish, has a \"Uijeongbu Budae-jjigae Street\" with a high concentration of specialty restaurants. Chains like Nolboo have operated over a thousand locations in the country.\nBudae-jjigae is often seen as symbolic of modern Korean history and even of American imperialism. Some older Koreans who lived through the Korean War avoid the dish, as they see it as a reminder of a painful past. Younger Koreans reportedly simply enjoy it, while acknowledging its complicated history.\n\nName\nThe word budae (\ubd80\ub300) refers to military camps. The suffix -jjigae (\ucc0c\uac1c) refers to a type of stew that has a thicker consistency than guk (soup) and has more ingredients.Its name is sometimes translated as \"army base stew\", \"army stew\", \"spicy sausage stew\", or \"sausage stew\".\n\nDescription\nBudae-jjigae is made with a wide variety of ingredients. The soup base can be plain water, although most prefer to make it with a fish, meat, or bone-based broth such as sagol-yuksu (\uc0ac\uace8\uc721\uc218; lit. sagol broth). Common ingredients include ham, sausage, lunch meats (e.g. Spam), baked beans, kimchi (fermented vegetables), instant ramen noodles, spicy flavoring packs that come with the ramen, cellophane noodles, gochujang (pepper paste), Vienna sausages, bacon, tofu, pork, ground beef, mandu (dumplings), macaroni, tteok (rice cakes), American cheese, mozzarella, minari (water celery), scallions, chili peppers, garlic, corn, zucchini, mushrooms, and other in-season vegetables. Spam or similar lunch meats are often described as a central part of the dish.\n\nPreparation\nThe dish is based on a stock or soup base, which can be either vegan or made with animal products. Seasoning paste is also used, and usually contains gochujang and other flavorants such as soy sauce and sugar. Chopped ingredients and noodles are then added to the stock, with variability on if the noodles are added before or after the liquid comes to a boil.The dish is often enjoyed communally, with multiple people sharing a pot. In restaurants, the dish comes with a set of base ingredients; more can be added for additional charge. The low cost of the ingredients, flexibility of the recipe, and ease of preparation have been praised.\n\nVariants\nIngredients for the dish are sold and exported from South Korea to other countries in kits. Various restaurants create their own versions of the dish with unorthodox ingredients. For example, it was reported in 2022 that a restaurant in Apgujeong used tomato soup as a base. Another restaurant in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province that was opened in 1973 has a budae-gogi (\"military base meat\") stir-fry that has been described as \"budae-jjigae without soup\".A variant of the dish is named after a U.S. President. A form of budae-jjigae developed in Yongsan-gu, Seoul is called Johnson-tang (\uc874\uc2a8\ud0d5; Jonseuntang; lit. Johnson soup), after Lyndon B. Johnson, who is said to have enjoyed the dish during his 1966 visit to South Korea. The restaurant Johnson ate the dish at, Bada Sikdang (\ubc14\ub2e4\uc2dd\ub2f9), still serves Johnson-tang as its signature dish. In Johnson-tang, kimchi is replaced with plain napa cabbage leaves, and ramen noodles are not added. Cheese is included by default, rather than being a requested addition (as is the case in some restaurants). In addition, while many budae-jjigae restaurants cook the dish at the table, Johnson-tang is served already cooked.There are Uijeongbu and Songtan styles of the dish. The Uijeongbu style uses barley-based gochujang, and has been described as having a thicker and spicier broth. The Songtan style prominently features napa cabbage.Some opt to exclude or substitute some of its salty, preserved, or perceived low-quality ingredients. Vegan varieties of the dish exist.\n\nHistory\nBackground\nThe 20th century was turbulent for the Korean peninsula. In 1945, Korea was liberated from its status as a colony of the Empire of Japan. Koreans had been exploited; for example, from 1939 to 1945, around 700,000\u2013800,000 Koreans were moved to Japan to work in slavery-like conditions. The situation was made worse due to the collapse of the economy that had been run by imperial Japan, and the subsequent division of Korea between the Soviet Civil Administration in the North and the United States Army Military Government in the South. The difficulties did not stop, and only worsened; around 10% of the population died during the Korean War, which greatly disrupted the economy and society. By the end of the war, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Around that time, many Koreans depended on international aid for survival.Many foreign products were not legally available to South Koreans, and some were made artificially expensive due to tariffs even until 1987. During a crackdown on black market trading under the Park Chung Hee administration, smuggling food like Spam was a crime punishable by death. To circumvent this, goods were smuggled off bases, notably by Korean prostitutes working there, who were widely socially stigmatized. Canned goods were particularly prized for their long shelf life and taste. Black markets called \"Yankee markets\" (\uc591\ud0a4\uc2dc\uc7a5; Yangki-sijang) formed that specialized in the trade of these goods. Some of these markets still exist today, including one in Incheon, although they are now regular markets.\n\nKkulkkuri-juk\nA predecessor to the dish is often called kkulkkuri-juk (\uafc0\uafc0\uc774\uc8fd; lit. piggy porridge), although it may have additionally gone by \"UN Stew\" (as in \"United Nations\"; \uc720\uc5d4\ud0d5; \uc720\uc5d4\u6e6f; yuen-tang). Its ingredients and method of cooking were more inconsistent than its successor's. One variant of the dish is attested to in the Pusan Perimeter. It was made with butter, canned pineapples, cabbages, onions, American cheese, and the occasional piece of meat (these rare pieces of scrap meat were often described as \ubd80\ub300\uace0\uae30; budae-gogi; lit. military base meat). The Busan variant of the dish also led to the development of dwaeji gukbap, a pork-based rice dish.The dish used American sausages, which tend to be greasier and saltier than Korean ones. Modern budae-jjigae is instead made with milder ingredients, and seasoning is added to the soup. It also lacked instant ramen, as ramen had not yet reached Korea by then. Coincidentally, Jeon Jung-yun (\uc804\uc911\uc724) cited the poor quality of kkulkkuri-juk as an inspiration for why he created the first domestic instant ramen brand Samyang Ramen. Jeon alleges he deliberately set ramen's price as low as possible, in order to make it accessible to people who would otherwise eat kkulkkuri-juk.Jeon felt that way because a number of people have recalled that, while the dish was highly sought after and enjoyed when consumed, its actual quality was poor in hindsight, especially because it was sometimes made with food scraps picked out of garbage from the military bases.One significant and common issue was the presence of inedible objects. The ends of cigarettes, toothpicks, and tissues could be found in the mix. In 2010, Lee Si-yeon recalled an incident from his boyhood, when he worked at Camp Henry:\nOne day, I mustered up the courage to speak to the military chaplain. He was a major called \"Ap\" (\uc555). In simple English, I asked if they could not throw away food scraps, as Koreans were picking them out of the garbage... He said \"Let me see this for myself\". [I feared that he would ban Koreans from taking out the food scraps]... He followed me to the market, where he bought a bowl of kkulkkuri-juk and took a bite. Major Ap's eyes welled up with tears. He ate the whole bowl in silence. The next day, [he told me that he had sent] a notice to all U.S. military bases that read \"Koreans are eating food scraps from the bases, so be cautious to not let foreign substances enter them.\"\nDespite the low quality of the dish, many Koreans still could not afford it. According to Jeon, a bowl cost around 5 won in 1963 (equivalent to \u20a9245 in 2017). The dish persisted until the mid-1960s, when the economic situation somewhat improved.\n\nDevelopment of budae-jjigae\nSince its development, budae-jjigae has remained consistently popular in South Korea. However, it's not known with certainty where the dish first arose; a number of restaurants and cities claim to be the origin. It even possibly arose independently in multiple places due to shared circumstances across South Korea.According to sociolinguist Yang Minho, the dish was first made in the northern part of South Korea and later propagated south, following the early trajectory of the Korean War. Possible places of origin include the regions of Uijeongbu, Pyeongtaek, Munsan, and Dongducheon.One person who claimed to be the original inventor was Heo Gi-Suk (\ud5c8\uae30\uc219), a North Korean defector. Heo worked at a fishcake stand in Uijeongbu, and occasionally encountered people who asked her to cook meats they had acquired from the nearby military base. She began by simply stirfrying the meats, but eventually turned the dish into a stew containing kimchi, lard, and wild sesame oil. Heo eventually opened a restaurant in 1960 called Odeng Sikdang (\uc624\ub385\uc2dd\ub2f9; lit. Fishcake Restaurant), which nominally served fishcakes, but was popular for serving budae-jjigae. This drew the ire of the customs office, which confiscated her ingredients and charged her fines on a number of occasions. The restaurant reportedly had long lines as of 2013, despite multiple competitors close by. Heo died in 2014, but the restaurant was still open as of June 2020.An article in the Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture claims that the dish was popular among factory workers in the 1960s and 1970s. However, according to one writer for the JoongAng Ilbo in 2016, the dish was not common in restaurants in the late 1960s. Another writer that published an article for the Cultural Heritage Administration in 2018 claimed that the dish did not reach national popularity until the 1970s.In 1963, instant ramen entered the South Korean market, and eventually made its way into budae-jjigae. Over time, anchovy broth (flavored with gochujang and kimchi) began to be used as the base of the soup, a practice that has since persisted in some variations of budae-jjigae.\n\nRecent history\nAfter the June Democratic Struggle of 1987, South Korea finally democratized after decades of dictatorships. In addition, by then the economy was significantly improved in the wake of the South Korean economic miracle. Spam was legalized in that year, after a Korean company purchased the rights to make it locally. According to an article by Hahna Yoon in the BBC, it is around this time that the dish's status changed from survival food to comfort food. That same year, Nolboo (\ub180\ubd80), a restaurant franchise specializing in the dish, opened. As of June 2020, it operated around 1,000 locations across the country.\n\nSpread\nThe dish now has some international popularity. In a 2015 episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Bourdain described the dish to journalist Anderson Cooper as \"a classic example of necessity being the mother of deliciousness\". Bourdain later featured the dish in his 2016 book Appetites: A Cookbook:\n\nIt's the ultimate dorm food. Just looking at the ingredients might make it sound like a horror, but it very quickly comes together and becomes delicious. It captures the essence of great cooking over the last few centuries: improvisational, born of war and hardship, nostalgic, sentimental, and transformative.\nAccording to a 2016 survey conducted by the Korea Tourism Organization of 200,000 Chinese tourists to South Korea, budae-jjigae was most often ranked as their favorite dish that they ate in the country. In 2019, the Michelin Guide included the dish on a list of \"Must-Eat Dishes in South Korea\".A number of restaurants in the United States have served the dish. This includes the Portland, Oregon restaurant Han Oak, and the New York City restaurant Danji. The dish is served in some restaurants in Beijing, China and Tokyo, Japan.\n\nCultural legacy\nDespite its widespread consumption, the dish has a somewhat mixed legacy. Some have noted that it evokes memories of a painful period in Korean history. In 2020, C\u0103t\u0103lina Stanciu wrote that \"[t]he transformation of the Korean people's trauma story is embodied through the bowl of budaejjigae\". Some older Koreans call the dish \"garbage stew\" and avoid it, mostly because of its history and also because of its unhealthy ingredients. In 2014, anthropologist Grace M. Cho wrote of the dish:\n\nI listened to the oral histories of Korean War survivors living in the United States, who spoke about the days during and after the war when they sought food outside U.S. Army bases. They recalled waiting in long lines outside the mess halls to buy bags of \"leftovers\", though some of them referred to the bags plainly as \"garbage\". They\u2019d say things like, \"Americans have the best food and throw it away, and then Koreans buy that garbage,\" their voices filled with humiliation, resentment, and gratitude all at once.Some note that the dish evokes images of American imperialism, particularly related to controversies surrounding U.S. military bases in South Korea. Some Korean Americans, particularly those who were adopted after the Korean War or are mixed-race children of war brides, have noted parallels between the dish's mix of cultures and their own. The inclusion of Spam is a point of contention, as the food has been described as \"the furthest thing from refined\" and made the subject of jokes in popular culture. This contrasts with the perception of the food in South Korea during the 1990s, where it was seen as somewhat of a luxury. Some of these emotions have been explored through art. A 2005 multimedium art piece entitled BooDaeChiGae displayed a video inside of a C-ration can. The video showed the dish being made, while the audio was of a Korean War survivor talking about living off garbage from military bases.These mixed emotions have led to some attempts to rename the dish. The city of Uijeongbu, which is north of Seoul and has many army bases, is known for its budae-jjigae. Since 1998, it has had a street with numerous budae-jjigae restaurants. In 1999, the local government attempted to change the name of the dish to Uijeongbu-jjigae (\"Uijeongbu Stew\"), and the street accordingly. The new name failed to gain traction, and the name of the street was eventually changed back.The dish has been used as a neutral or positive metaphor for cosmopolitanism. In a 2020 book, researcher of Korean cinema Christina Klein used the term \"budae-jjigae cinema\" to describe South Korean films after the Korean War. She compared the invention of the dish to how filmmakers picked and chose various ideas \"without asking within profoundly unequal relations of power, and [incorporated] that material into new cultural production\". Jeong Dong-hyeon, writing for The Chosun Ilbo, likened the food to the music group BTS, which borrows elements of Western culture but is widely accepted as Korean. In 2017, the mayor of Uijeongbu used the dish as a metaphor for U.S.\u2013South Korea ties. Western interest in the dish has been examined. Nicolyn Woodcock criticized Bourdain's portrayal of the dish, pointing to how Bourdain called the dish a \"gift of the G.I.\", how he allegedly played into perceptions of Asian exoticism, and how he did not explore the social connotations surrounding it.Whether budae-jjigae can be considered Korean cuisine has been called into question. According to one 2022 survey, Korean adults tend to view the food as Korean but less so than dishes like kimchi-jjigae. The chef Park Chan-il contended that Korean cuisine had previously accepted new adaptations, and that what mattered was the enjoyment of the dish. She pointed out that kimchi, which Koreans consider quintessentially Korean, only became spicy after the Portuguese brought peppers to Asia in the 16th century.Others embrace the identity of the dish, while acknowledging its past. Some see it as a hallmark of South Korea's success via its globalization. In 2020, Chef Hooni Kim, whose restaurant served the dish and was the first Korean restaurant to obtain a Michelin star, observed that younger Koreans tend to have more positive reactions to the dish. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t think Korea\u2019s younger generation considers the country having been poor as something to be ashamed of. Budae-jjigae is an honest portrayal of where our country was and how far our country has come.\n\nSee also\nPagpag: a dish born from poverty in the Philippines\nMulligan stew: an American poverty dish\nHan (cultural): Korean expression of sorrow related to the events of the 20th century\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nREFUGEES \u2013 footage of refugees living in difficult conditions during the Korean War\n(\ud604\ucda9\uc77c \ud2b9\uc9d1) \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc758\ubc25\uc0c1 - \uac00\uc7a5\uc2ac\ud508 \ud55c\ub07c, \uc804\uc7c1\uacfc\ubc25\uc0c1 | 20130606 KBS\ubc29\uc1a1 on YouTube \u2013 a 2013 Korean-language documentary covering wartime food in South Korea.

        "body": "A chafing dish is a metal cooking or serving pan on a stand with an alcohol burner holding chafing fuel below it. It is used for cooking at table, notably in Gueridon service, or as a food warmer for keeping dishes at a buffet warm.\nHistorically, a chafing dish (from the French chauffer, \"to make warm\") is a kind of portable grate raised on a tripod, originally heated with charcoal in a brazier, and used for foods that require gentle cooking, away from the \"fierce\" heat of direct flames. The chafing dish could be used at table or provided with a cover for keeping food warm on a buffet. Double dishes that provide a protective water jacket are known as bains-marie and help keep delicate foods, such as fish, warm while preventing overcooking.\n\nHistory\nThe Roman politician and writer Cicero described a \"kind of saucepan of Corinthian brass\", writing \"This simple and ingenious vessel possesses a double bottom, the upper one holds the light delicacies . . . and the fire is lit underneath\".Fragments of ceramic chafing dishes are common in the archaeology of medieval city sites, such as York, England. Chafing dishes in the form of charcoal-burning braziers are familiar in 17th-century American inventories almost from the start. Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne, Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois (Paris, 1652) mentions the use of a r\u00e9chaut in a recipe for champignons \u00e0 l'olivier. In describing the Velazquez genre painting (illustration), sometimes art historians not handy in the kitchen describe her as frying eggs in her earthenware dish. In 1520, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s reported to Charles V the manner in which Montezuma was served meals in Tenochtitlan:\n\nHe was served in the following manner: Every day as soon as it was light, six hundred nobles and men of rank were in attendance at the palace, who either sat, or walked about the halls and galleries, and passed their time in conversation, but without entering the apartment where his person was. The servants and attendants of these nobles remained in the court-yards, of which there were two or three of great extent, and in the adjoining street, which was also very spacious. They all remained in attendance from morning until night; and when his meals were served, the nobles were likewise served with equal profusion, and their servants and secretaries also had their allowance. Daily his larder and wine-cellar were open to all who wished to eat or drink. The meals were served by three or four hundred youths, who brought on an infinite variety of dishes; indeed, whenever he dined or supped, the table was loaded with every kind of flesh, fish, fruits, and vegetables that the country produced. As the climate is cold, they put a chafing-dish with live coals under every plate and dish, to keep them warm...\nIn England silver braziers without handles, upon which a dish would be set, are mentioned in the reign of Queen Anne; wooden balls kept the heat of the charcoal in the pierced container from being transferred to the table surface. Dish-crosses and the chafing dish with a handle were introductions of the reign of George II. In the American colonies, \"One chafing dish\" was inventoried among the silver at Abraham de Peyster's death in New York, 1728, though only two colonial New York examples are known to survive.In a light form and heated over a spirit lamp, a chafing dish could also be  used for cooking various dainty dishes at table\u2014of fish, cream, eggs or cheese\u2014for which silver chafing dishes with fine heat-insulating wooden handles were made in the late 19th century, when \"chafing-dish suppers\" became fashionable, even in households where a kitchen maid prepared all the ingredients beforehand. Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper instruction for use, suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmer's Chafing Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898.\n\nModern uses\nHosts dazzled their guests not just with their sparkling new equipment, but with their flamb\u00e9ing and their cr\u00eapes Suzette. Betty Crocker hailed the chafing dish... as providing dinners that were \"exotic, sophisticated, and intimate.\"\nModern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles. Standard uses of a chafing-dish in restaurants are finishing the sauces of dishes such as pressed duck and fettuccine Alfredo or in presenting flamb\u00e9 dishes such as cr\u00eapes Suzette and Steak Diane. In homes, it can be used to prepare and present dishes at table which must be kept hot, notably  Welsh rarebit and cheese fondue. The home version sometimes includes a cover.\nHome and restaurant chafing dishes have gone in and out of fashion, notably in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s.In institutional and catering use, chafing dishes often consist of large, covered rectangular pans, sometimes disposable, held in a rack or frame over water heated by an alcohol burner as a kind of steam table for keeping food warm at a buffet. They are not used for cooking or reheating food.\n\nSee also\nChafing fuel\nList of cooking vessels\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBraziers and chafing dishes",

        "body": "Gopchang-jeongol (\uacf1\ucc3d\uc804\uace8) or beef tripe hot pot is a spicy Korean stew or casserole made by boiling beef tripe, vegetables, and seasonings in beef broth. Gopchang refers to beef small intestines, while jeongol refers to a category of stew or casserole in Korean cuisine. Although the dish is mainly based on beef gopchang, other parts of beef innards are also used to give the dish a richer flavor and chewy texture.To remove any odor and excessive fat in the dish, any white fat adhering to the intestines should be meticulously cleaned out by rubbing them with wheat flour and salt and washing them several times. Since cooking the dish requires not only specialized cooking techniques and a great deal of labor to prepare, but also very fresh ingredients, gopchang jeongol is generally eaten at restaurants specializing in beef innards dishes. The dish, which is seasoned with a hot and spicy red chili-based sauce, is served as a main entr\u00e9e, accompanied with a bowl of steamed rice. It is often shared between several diners on the center of the table, and is also a popular anju when drinking alcoholic beverages such as soju in South Korea.\n\nIngredients\nKoreans classify beef innards into subcategories, which include yang (\uc591), beoljibyang (\ubc8c\uc9d1\uc591), cheonyeop (\ucc98\ub151), makchang (\ub9c9\ucc3d), gopchang (\uacf1\ucc3d, also called sochang \uc18c\ucc3d), and daechang (\ub300\ucc3d).\nThe first chamber of a beef stomach is called yang and is high in protein. It has been recommended for a person in weak health to drink the broth of yang since ancient times. The outer portion of the intestines is hard and lumpy, with a lot of black membranes and unclean materials attached between the projections, so those should be thoroughly cleaned out before cooking.\nGopchang (small intestines of cattle) is commonly referred to as such because of its curvy shape rather than as sochang, which literally means \"small intestines\". Compared to other cuts of meat, gopchang is high in iron and vitamins. It is relatively inexpensive and has a characteristic flavor and a chewy yet palatable texture, so it is used in many Korean dishes such as gui (grilled dishes) or bokkeum (stir-fried dishes).\nDaechang means \"large intestines\".\n\nPreparation\nThe broth for the dish can be either a mixture of two broths, made from beef gopchang and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by simmering beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef gopchang and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef gopchang has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef gopchang broth, cleaned beef gopchang, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed in a large pot with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef gopchang and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.Oyster mushrooms are parboiled in salted boiling water, slightly pressed to squeeze water, torn by their grain, and seasoned. Dried shiitake mushrooms are soaked in lukewarm water, and if a small amount of sugar is added to the water, that helps the mushrooms to rehydrate more quickly. The stipes of the mushroom are taken out, and the caps are shredded and seasoned. Green chili peppers are seeded and chopped and onions and carrots are chopped into pieces the same size as the peppers. Scallions are cut into long diagonal strips.In a pan, the remaining vegetables are placed on the bottom, and the marinated beef gopchang and brisket are placed over them in a circular fashion. The shredded mushrooms and sliced vegetables are arranged between the gopchang and meat. The prepared broths are mixed together, seasoned with salt, and poured little by little into the pan. When the dish is cooked, any floating foam is skimmed off and the gopchang jeongol is served.\n\nSee also\nTripe\nHaejangguk, soups eaten as a hangover remedy\nList of casserole dishes\nList of soups\nKorean cuisine\nList of Korean dishes\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n(in Korean) \ubb38\ud654\uc18d\uc74c\uc2dd; \ub9cc\ud654 <\uc0ac\ub791\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5b4\ub3c4 \uba39\uace0 \uc0b4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4> \uacf1\ucc3d\uc804\uace8 at Hankooki.com\n(in Korean) \uacbd\ub0a8\u00b7\uc6b8\uc0b0\uc758 \ub9db\uac70\ub9ac <48> \uc6b8\uc0b0 \ubb34\uac70\ub3d9 \uacf1\ucc3d\uac70\ub9ac at Kooje sinmun\n(in Korean) \uc774\ud604\uc8fc \uae30\uc790\uc758 \ub9db\uc9d1 \ub530\ub77c\uac00\uae30 \uae08\uace1\ub3d9 \u2018\uc81c\uc77c \uacf1\ucc3d\u2019 at Suwon ilbo",

        "body": "Haidilao International Holding Ltd., or Haidilao (Chinese: \u6d77\u5e95\u635e), is a Chinese hot pot chain renowned for industrial innovation and robotic automation.  Founded in Jianyang, Sichuan in 1994, it has since grown to become China\u2019s largest hot pot chain. Its restaurants typically operate under the name Haidilao Hot Pot. As of 2022, Haidilao had around 1,300 restaurants in China, Hong Kong, Macau, with its overseas unit, Super Hi International, running 97 outlets around the world, including in Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the UK and the United States.; annual revenue is estimated to be more than CN\u00a510 billion.\n\nEtymology\nIn Mandarin, haidilao can be translated as deep sea fishing, or literally \"scooping the bottom of the ocean.\" The origin of this term comes from a Chinese idiom, h\u01ceid\u01d0l\u0101oyu\u00e8 (\u6d77\u5e95\u635e\u6708, lit. \"fishing for the moon\"), a metaphor for a hopeless endeavor. This idiom was originally derived from the Buddhist poem Song of Enlightenment (\u8b49\u9053\u6b4c). The term haidilao is also used by mahjong players to refer to a rare and lucky situation when a player wins with the last tile.\n\nHistory\nIn March 1994, a then unknown restauranteur Zhang Long opened the first Haidilao hot pot restaurant along with three other founders with 8,000 Yuan in Jianyang, Sichuan Province. Haidilao grew competitively with an emphasis on customer service. After five years, Haidilao started to expand beyond Sichuan to other provinces like Xi'an, Shanxi province, and other parts of the world.In 2018, Haidilao Hot Pot served more than 160 million customers, with an average daily table turnover rate (i.e. the number of parties hosted per table per day) of 5.0. Haidilao Hot Pot has more than 36 million VIP members and 60,000+ staff.In 2019, Haidilao opened the first robot-aided hotpot restaurant in Beijing.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Haidilao closed all stores in mainland China on January 26, 2020, to decrease the spread of the virus. As a result, Haidilao recorded significant losses. A similar hotpot chain restaurant called Xiabu Xiabu also closed around 20% of its total stores as a response to the decreased consumer demand during COVID. On March 12, 2020, with cases decreasing in China, Haidilao began reopening stores.However, even after reopening, business was slow. Haidilao also faced backlash for increasing prices to offset pandemic losses, and the number of people restaurants could serve was limited by government pandemic restrictions.In 2021, as part of an expansion plan, Haidilao opened 421 new restaurants, but it also closed 276 in an effort to improve the operations and profitability of existing stores.In 2022, in the wake of China's zero-COVID policy, Haidilao's shares fell more than 60%. Haidilao is focusing on expanding its international presence, spinning off its overseas unit, Super Hi International.\n\nInnovation and expansion\nHaidilao and the Japanese electronics company Panasonic jointly launched a \"smart\" restaurant in 2018. This restaurant relies on Panasonic's robotics and image recognition technology to achieve full automation of the kitchen. After the customer orders the food with tablet computer (iPad), the system in the kitchen can automatically recognize the dishes and puts them into the tray.\nHaidilao has more than 180 chains globally, more than 20,000 staff, and an annual turnover of 5 billion RMB (almost US$0.77 billion).By the end of June 30, 2020, Haidilao Hot Pot had 935 stores in operation. In addition to the many locations in China, the company serves the areas of Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan, United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates.The company opened its first restaurant outside of mainland China in Clarke Quay, Singapore, in 2012. This was followed by its first US outlet, which opened in Westfield Santa Anita (California) in September 2013. Haidilao continued to develop its network abroad, entering the South Korean market in 2014, the Taiwanese and Japanese markets in 2015, the Hong Kong market in 2017, and the Canadian market in 2018.\n\nIPO\nIn 2008, Haidilao planned to increase $600 million to $700 million in the Hong Kong IPO which could increase the popularity in the global market.In 2017, Haidilao's net profit rose 22% to 1.19 billion yuan, and revenue increased 36% to 10.64 billion yuan.In 2018, Haidilao raised nearly US$1 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO). The IPO figures show that even though Haidilao faced some safety issues over the past two years, investors are still feeling positive of Haidilao growth in the future.Founded as a privately held company, Haidilao International Holding Ltd. filed to launch an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong in 2018, aiming to raise up to US$700 million for further expansion.As of 2018, Haidilao's IPO price of 17.80 Hong Kong dollars a share makes its market capitalization $12 billion.\n\nOperations\nHaidilao enforces strict rules when selecting food suppliers. There are more than 20 dipping sauces on Haidilao's self-service condiment table. Side dishes like peanuts, cucumbers, and fresh food are always provided. Customers can select up to four different soup bases in one pot.\n\nAutomation\nHaidilao restaurants have automated kitchens with robot chefs to increase efficiency and robots for food delivery.In 2013, Haidilao developed a new videoconference service where customers could see each other by using video conference facilities and remotely videoconference with customers at other Haidilao restaurants.\n\n\"Hi to send\" service\nHaidilao created the \u201cHi to send\u201d delivery service in 2003. Once a customer orders food to be delivered, staff will send an electromagnetic pan, an induction cooker, and a wiring board to customers\u2019 home, where they will also help the customers divide their food. They wait outside until customers finish their food, after which they will take away the kitchenware. Since 2013, Haidilao is open for 24 hours a day and offers service of delivery food.\n\nAmenities\nEvery Haidilao restaurant has a waiting room for customers, some of which offer additional services such as nail salon or children's play areas. Additional free before-meal services and amenities include a car wash, fruits, snacks, drinks, and board games.During the meal, staff offer diners aprons and mobile phone bags, and provide small hairpins for long-haired customers. If customers are celebrating a birthday party or wedding ceremony at Haidilao, they get a special gift. While dining, the restaurant puts on face-changing and hand-pulled noodles performances.Customers are given snacks, fruit, mints, and toothpicks after their meal.\n\nIssues\nHygiene\nOn August 25, 2017, hygiene problems were reported by the Legal Evening News. A video of a rat lying on a sink was uploaded to Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. After three and a half hours, Haidilao posted an apology letter about the hygiene issues.Haidilao indicated that all stores needed to have a \u201cbright kitchen\u201d, meaning that the kitchen is now visible to all customers thanks to the installment of transparent glass and opening up of the space.The Beijing Municipal Food and Drug Administration had two meetings with the representatives of this Haidilao's hygiene problem and required Haidilao to make rectification to their cleanliness, resulting in the requirement that all stores in Beijing would need to be inspected within one month.\n\nPrice hikes\nOn March 12, 2020, Haidilao reopened many stores after the COVID-19 situation in mainland China improved. However, customers were shocked by the price hikes; some even stated online that they would not go back to Haidilao again. After customer complaints, a Haidilao representative stated that price increases would be limited to 6%, with each restaurant being able to define their own prices.\n\nAwards and certifications\nHaidilao Hot Pot has won more than ten titles and honors such as \u201cAdvanced Enterprise\u201d, \u201cConsumer satisfaction unit\u201d and \u201cFamous Hot Pot\u201d in Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan and other provinces in China. From 2008 to 2012, it won the title of \u201cTop 10 Hot Pot Restaurants\u201d by the public comment website for 5 consecutive years in China. At the same time, it won the honorary title of \u201cTop 100 Chinese Catering Enterprises\u201d for 5 consecutive years. Haidilao became a successful business case of Harvard Business School in 2009. On May 27, 2011, \u201cHaidilao\u201d was awarded \u201cChina Famous Brand\u201d. From 2007 to 2018, the hot pot restaurant won the \"China Top 100 Catering Companies\" for 12 consecutive years. Haidilao won the \u201cBest Hot Pot\u201d, \u201cOutstanding Service,\u201d or \u201cOutstanding Chinese Restaurant of the Year.\u201d prizes in magazines such as Time out and Beijinger in 2018.\n\nSee also\nChinese restaurant\nList of Chinese restaurants\nLittle Sheep Group\nSichuan cuisine\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nHe, Laura (September 18, 2018). \"Chinese hotpot chain Haidilao's US$963 million IPO makes it Hong Kong's fifth largest this year\".

        "body": "Little Sheep Group Limited is a Chinese restaurant company that was founded in 1999 in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. The company specializes in operating hot pot restaurants, condiments, and meat processing.\nLittle Sheep currently has over 300 restaurant chains in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, the United States, Japan, and Canada. In 2007, Little Sheep was named the most popular Chinese hot pot restaurant by the Chinese Restaurant Association. It was subsequently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2008. It became China's first branded catering enterprise listed in Hong Kong.\nLittle Sheep posted \u00a52 billion in revenues in 2010, which accounted for two percent of dining-out receipts in China.In 2011, Little Sheep was sold to Yum! Brands Inc, a U.S.-based fast-food franchise conglomerate. Yum agreed to buy Little Sheep for $587 million in May 2011 but the deal was delayed for four months by a Chinese Ministry of Commerce antitrust investigation. Little Sheep was delisted from the Hong Kong Exchange in February 2012. In 2016, Yum! Brands spun off their Chinese operations into Yum China, which includes Little Sheep. Happy Lamb was also a similar hot pot brand founded by the original owner of Little Sheep in 2017.\n\nHistory\nLittle Sheep was founded by Zhang Gang. There are two versions of the company's founding in Baotou. According to one story, Zhang Gang, who was busy running a telecommunications business, developed a habit of eating hot pot with friends rather than cooking; this gave him the idea to open a hot pot restaurant. Another version of the story is that Zhang Gang observed the commercial success of a chain of three hot pot restaurants in Hohhot; convinced of the business potential of the hot pot restaurant format, he purchased hot-pot-based recipes and began to develop Little Sheep.On August 8, 1999, the first Little Sheep outlet of the Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was opened in Baotou City.\n\nDevelopment\nDue to the good operation of the first Little Sheep restaurant, founders successfully opened two Little Sheep Hot Pot restaurants in Qingshan District and Donghe District of Baotou City two months later, and the business was equally popular. This allowed the founders of Little Sheep to start the chain-store operation. They started opening more Little Sheep restaurants in other countries as well as of April 2000. In early 2001, the Little Sheep meat product processing base was established.\nIn May 2001, Shanghai branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 30 direct investment restaurants).\nIn January 2002, the Beijing branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 15 direct investment restaurants).\nIn January 2002, Shenzhen branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 18 direct investment restaurants).\nIn November 2002, Little Sheep Hot pot Store was opened in Chengdu, and entered the most competitive hot pot market in China,  therefore challenging Sichuan hot pot brands. It achieved an income record of 170,000 yuan in  one day.\nIn January 2003, the Little Sheep Condiment Base was established.\nIn November 2003, Little Sheep's first overseas chain store opened in Los Angeles, U.S.\nIn September 2004, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. ranked among the Top 500 Chinese companies.\nOn November 12, 2004, \"LITTLE SHEEP\" and its logo were recognized as China's Famous Trade Mark.\nOn October 12, 2005, the first directly operated store was opened in Toronto, Canada.\nIn June 2006, it was again selected as \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" with a brand value of 5.677 billion Yuan.\nOn June 22, 2007, Little Sheep was selected for the third time as the \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" and was ranked in 104th place in the Top 500 Chinese companies with a brand value of 5.916 billion Yuan.\nOn November 11, 2007, at the fourth annual Top 100 Chinese Restaurant Awards in New York, U,S., it won three honours: Chinese Best 100 Local Cuisine, Chinese Best 100 New Restaurant, and Chinese Best 100 Healthy Cuisine.\nOn June 12, 2008, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was successfully listed in Hong Kong\nUntil January 2010, Little Sheep Company had a total of more than 60,000 employees, drove more than 240,000 people in related employment, and increased more than 200,000 farmers and herdsmen's income.\n\nAcquisition by Yum! Brands\nOn May 13, 2011, Yum! Brands announced it intended to acquire Little Sheep Group Co., Ltd. at a premium of approximately 30% in cash. After the acquisition, Little Sheep Group would be delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The transaction was approved by relevant regulatory agencies such as China's Ministry of Commerce. Because Yum! Brands and Little Sheep Group are relatively large, according to the law, this transaction is subject to China's anti-monopoly.After the acquisition in February 2012, Yum! Brands held approximately 93.2% of the shares of Little Sheep, the rest of which were owned by Zhang Gang and other founders. Yujing Su, chairman and chief executive officer of Yum! Brands' China Department, said, \"Yum! Brands will use its extensive experience in operating restaurants to further enhance the brand's value and influence of Little Sheep, in order to make Little Sheep a strong leader in the Chinese hot pot market. \" Zhang Gang was also confident Little Sheep would have a bright future in the international market.\n\nCurrent situation\nYum! Brands' management system is different from Little Sheep's original management system. Because of the difference, many managers quit. Yum! Brands closed many poorly managed and poorly located stores without many commercial interests. When Little Sheep was at its peak, there were more than 720 restaurants. Yum! Brands wanted to reduce this number and focus on high-potential outlets. After the cull, fewer than 200 restaurants remained open.With the rapid development of the catering industry, especially the hot pot market, the traditional marketing model can no longer meet the needs of its future development. Little Sheep, as the leader of hot pot restaurant chains, tried to develop its online  marketing approach.\n\nHappy Lamb\nZhang Gang, the founder of Little Sheep Group, re-founded the hot pot brand \"Happy Lamb\" (\u5feb\u4e50\u5c0f\u7f8a) in 2017 due to the dissatisfaction of the new business philosophies of \"Little Sheep\" under the Yum!. Most of the \"Little Sheep\"'s overseas restaurants are rebranded as \"Happy Lamb\".\n\nCompany culture\nThe goal of Little Sheep Company is to deepen the new food method of \u201csimmering lamb without dipping in complex ingredients\u201d. The Little Sheep brand has a good reputation among consumers in China.\n\nCooking method\nInstant-boiled mutton, a style of hot pot, has been eaten in China for a long time, but traditionally it's prepared in boiling water and the pieces of meat are dipped in sauce by each diner after cooking.  Because the smell of raw lamb is not accepted by southerners in China, the consumption of lamb and mutton is regional. \"Little Sheep\" invented a method of \"simmering mutton without dipped in ingredients\": a pot-base soup made from dozens of condiments. By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the smell of lamb while retaining its flavour. This method is more convenient than the tradition of \"instant-boiled mutton\".\n\nMeat quality\nMeat for \"Little Sheep\" is sourced from Inner Mongolia grassland, the Xilinguole grassland (\u9521\u6797\u90ed\u52d2\u8349\u539f), which produces Mongolian sheep, such as the Wuzhumuqin sheep (\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", Sunite sheep (\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and the Wulatetan sheep (\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". Only six-month-old lamb is selected, because the meat is fresh and tender rather than smelly or stale.\n\nMenu\nThe Little Sheep serves lamb, beef, and other specials. Mongolian wine is served at Little Sheep.\n\nSee also\nChinese restaurant\nList of Chinese restaurants\nHaidilao\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nLittle-Sheep Catering Chain Company Limited (Chinese Version)",

Its shape is elongated and cylindrical with a golden yellow colour, typical of good cooking. It melts slightly in your mouth with a crispy, soft and gritty texture, with a taste of milk.The achira is also known as saga or chisgua in Colombia. They are consumed as food by the Chibchas in Colombia, but it is thought that their use has extended throughout the Andes due to commercial exchanges with other indigenous communities.\n\nPreparation\nHuila is the biggest producer of achira flour cake in the world. Achira biscuits are still prepared to a traditional recipe and cooked in clay ovens. Achira flour, the main ingredient, is subtracted from the achira plant, whose origin is South American and has been used by the Chibchas for their food.\n\nCharacteristics and qualities\nExternal appearance: Oval shape, with variable dimensions, between 3 and 8 centimetres long and a diameter between 1 and 2 centimetres.\nSurface: Sandy.\nColour: Golden yellow, without artificial colouring.\nAroma: With a mild dairy aroma\nTexture: Crunchy (light toasted), gritty and melts gently on the palate.\nWeight: It ranges between 2.6 a. 8 grams according to the portion of dough put on the tray\nInternal appearance: Sandy compact, if possible without voids between its walls.\n\nReputation\nThe achira biscuit is a fundamental part of the region's traditional culture, and due to its great recognition as a typical product of the department of Huila and its high local consumption, it has managed to diversify nationally and internationally.Press articles highlight the presence of the achira biscuit in the national and international market. For example, the article \"The Achira Biscuit opens export markets\" mentions that one of the delicacies of the gastronomic department of Huila, the traditional achira biscuit, began to open markets in the United States and Spain and recently was second in a large project in Japan. The article highlights that the traditional achira biscuit is made by hand and that last year it managed to sell 114 thousand dollars abroad.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "An Afghan is a traditional New Zealand biscuit made from flour, butter, cornflakes, sugar and cocoa powder, topped with chocolate icing and a half walnut. The recipe has a high proportion of butter, and relatively low sugar, and no leavening (rising agent), giving it a soft, dense and rich texture, with crunchiness from the cornflakes, rather than from a high sugar content. The high butter content gives a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture, and the sweetness of the icing offsets the low sugar and the cocoa bitterness.\n\nName\nDespite its name, the biscuit's place of origin is thought to be New Zealand. A recipe in The Timaru Herald for \"Afghans\" (minus the icing and walnut) dates from 1934, and an otherwise identical \"Chocolate Cornflakes\" biscuit recipe, complete with icing and walnut, was in the same publication of the previous year.There are many theories in circulation about the origin of the name \"Afghan\", ranging from the First Anglo-Afghan War to the biscuit's texture and colour being likened to the landscape of Afghanistan,  while one theory suggests it was named after the traditional Afghan hat, the pakol. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, the manufacturer of the commercially produced version of biscuit, Griffin's Foods announced in June 2020 that they would rename the product. In a statement issued by the company, it noted that the name of the biscuit was possibly a reference to the colour of \"Afghan brown\", which could possibly reference the dark skin of Afghan people. Although they acknowledged \"there are other theories in circulation\", this caused a debate over the name. The decision came amidst a wave of name changes in New Zealand over foodstuffs with names deemed racist or otherwise culturally offensive by some. The biscuit was eventually renamed \"Milk Chocolate Roughs\" by Griffin's, which advertised the renaming with a new slogan: \"Same bikkie. New name.\" However, the name \"Afghan\" is still the one used by other companies.\n\nIngredients and recipe\nAccording to the Edmonds Cookery Book, a batch of 24 afghans is made by combining 200 g (7 oz) butter, 115 g (4 oz) white sugar, 160 g (6 oz) all-purpose flour, 25 g (1 oz) cocoa powder, and 50 g (2 oz) cornflakes. Tablespoon-sized balls of the mixture are formed, placed on a greased baking tray, and baked at 180 \u00b0C (360 \u00b0F) for around 15 minutes. Once the biscuits are cooled, they are iced with chocolate icing and the half-walnut placed on top. The Edmonds recipe has changed over the years; for example, the 24th De Luxe (1987) edition of the cookbook only called for 75 g (3 oz) of sugar.Some variations on the recipe exist; crushed Weet-Bix may be substituted for cornflakes, for instance.\n\nSee also\nList of cookies\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach, so I'm baking President Bush some ANZAC biscuits.\" Cartoon.

        "body": "Arrowroot is a starch obtained from the rhizomes (rootstock) of several tropical plants, traditionally Maranta arundinacea, but also Florida arrowroot from Zamia integrifolia, and tapioca from cassava (Manihot esculenta), which is often labeled arrowroot. Polynesian arrowroot or pia (Tacca leontopetaloides), and Japanese arrowroot (Pueraria lobata), also called kudzu, are used in similar ways. In India, it is called palua.\n\nHistory\nArchaeological studies in the Americas show evidence of arrowroot cultivation as early as 7,000 years ago. The name may come from aru-aru (meal of meals) in the language of the Caribbean Arawak people, for whom the plant was a staple. It has also been suggested that the name comes from arrowroot's use in treating poison-arrow wounds, as it draws out the poison when applied to the site of the injury.In the early days of carbonless copy paper, arrowroot, because of its fine grain-size, was a widely used ingredient. After an economical way of centrifugally separating wheat flour was devised, arrowroot lost its role in papermaking.\n\nUses\nCultivation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSaint Vincent has a long history of arrowroot production. The industry started as the food and medicine of the Carib and Garifuna peoples, and developed to the status of a major export of St. Vincent during the period 1900 to 1965. It became an important commodity in colonial trade in the 1930s. As the sugar industry declined in the nineteenth century, cultivation of arrowroot was developed to fill the void. Since then, the area cultivated has declined steadily as other crops, particularly bananas, have gained wider acceptance by farmers. Evidence of its former importance is indicated by the ruins of the various magnificent 19th-century factories located in valleys on the St. Vincent mainland.Arrowroot cultivation is now concentrated on farms located north of the Rabacca River, particularly in the Owia area. This is also the area where the population of Carib descent is concentrated. In 1998/99, the industry produced 312,000 lb (142,000 kg) of starch, about 3% of the peak level in the 1960s.\nIn the past, the St. Vincent arrowroot industry played an important role in the economy of the island, contributing close to 50% of the country's foreign export earnings, and was the principal source of employment and income of the rural people from the 1930s to the 1960s.The plant is propagated from rhizomes and cultivation takes place at elevations up to 300 metres on the eastern and windward facing side of the highlands of St. Vincent. Cultivation covers an area of about 3,700 ha and some 80% of the crop is grown by small farmers. The arrowroot plant is very hardy and not very demanding in its requirements. St. Vincent, particularly the north-east coast, provides the ideal growing conditions for optimal yields: deep, well drained, slightly acidic soils and a hot, humid climate. Some farmers produce the crop by shifting cultivation on the cleared forested slopes.\nThe harvesting season extends from October to May. On the larger estates, the harvesting of the rhizome usually proceeds from the base of a hill towards the top. Harvesting involves breaking off the rhizome from the shoot. Planting and harvesting are inter-related in that when the rhizomes are harvested the shoot is replanted at the same time. In St. Vincent, much use is made of rural unemployment and many women workers are involved in the various phases of operation. Mechanical harvesters have recently been introduced, allowing faster arrowroot harvesting.\nSix factories process the island's arrowroot and large processing plants are located at Belle Vue and at Owia.\n\nStarch extraction process\nArrowroot tubers contain about 23% starch. They are first washed, and then cleaned of the paper-like scale. The scales must be carefully removed before extracting the starch because they impart a disagreeable flavour. After removing the scale, the roots are washed again, drained and finally reduced to a pulp by beating them in mortars or subjecting them to the action of a wheel rasp. The milky liquid thus obtained is passed through a coarse cloth or hair sieve and the pure starch, which is insoluble, is allowed to settle at the bottom. The wet starch is dried in the sun or in a drying house.  The result is a powder, the \"arrowroot\" of commerce, that is quickly packed for market in air-tight cans, packages or cases.\nArrowroot starch has in the past been quite extensively adulterated with potato starch and other similar substances. Pure arrowroot, like other pure starches, is a light, white powder (the mass feeling firm to the finger and crackling like newly fallen snow when rubbed or pressed), odourless when dry, but emitting a faint, peculiar odour when mixed with boiling water, and swelling on cooking into a perfect jelly, which can be used to make a food that is very smooth in consistency\u2014unlike adulterated articles, mixed with potato flour and other starches of lower value, which contain larger particles.\nMicroscopically the arrow root starch is oval in shape and with hilum at the proximal end.\n\nCulinary\nArrowroot can be consumed in the form of biscuits, puddings, jellies, cakes, hot sauces, and also with beef tea, milk or veal broth. Kudzu arrowroot (Pueraria lobata) is used in noodles in Korean and Vietnamese cuisine. In the Victorian era it was used, boiled with a little flavouring added, as an easily digestible food for children and people with dietary restrictions. In Burma, arrowroot tubers, which are called artarlut, are boiled or steamed and eaten with salt and oil.\nArrowroot makes clear, shimmering fruit gels and prevents ice crystals from forming in homemade ice cream. It can also be used as a thickener for acidic foods, such as East Asian sweet and sour sauce. It is used in cooking to produce a clear, thickened sauce, such as a fruit sauce. It will not make the sauce go cloudy, like cornstarch, flour, or other starchy thickening agents would.\nThe lack of gluten in arrowroot flour makes it useful as a replacement for wheat flour for those with a gluten intolerance. It is, however, relatively high in carbohydrates and low in protein (approximately 7.7%) and does not provide a complete substitute for wheat flour in bread-making.\nArrowroot thickens at a lower temperature than flour or cornstarch, is not weakened by acidic ingredients, has a more neutral taste, and is not affected by freezing. It does not mix well with dairy, forming a slimy mixture. It is recommended that arrowroot be mixed with a cool liquid before adding to a hot fluid. The mixture should be heated only until the mixture thickens and removed immediately to prevent the mixture from thinning. Overheating tends to break down arrowroot's thickening property. Two teaspoons of arrowroot can be substituted for one tablespoon of cornstarch, or one teaspoon of arrowroot for one tablespoon of wheat flour.\n\nShove halfpenny\nThe English pub game of Shove Halfpenny, involving sliding a coin across a graduated slate board, traditionally uses arrowroot powder as a lubricating medium.\n\nSee also\nPolynesian arrowroot\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Ward, Artemas (1911). \"Arrow-root\".

        "body": "Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst (or Chalkhurst), commonly known as the Biddenden Maids (1100\u20131134), were a pair of conjoined twins supposedly born in Biddenden, Kent, England, in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the Bread and Cheese Lands. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual dole of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775, the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard biscuits imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.\nAlthough the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names \"Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst\" were first used.\nEdward Hasted, the local historian of Kent, has dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was \"a vulgar tradition\" arising from a misinterpretation of the image, while influential historian Robert Chambers accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.\nIn 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.\n\nLegend\nAccording to tradition Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, or Chalkhurst, were born to relatively wealthy parents in Biddenden, Kent, in the year 1100. The pair were said to be conjoined at both the shoulder and the hip. They grew up conjoined, and are said to have \"had frequent quarrels, which sometimes terminated in blows\". At the age of 34, Mary Chulkhurst died suddenly. Doctors proposed to separate the still-living Eliza from her sister's body but she refused, saying \"as we came together we will also go together\", and died six hours afterwards. In their wills, the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around 20 acres (8 ha) in total to the local church, with the income from these lands (claimed to have been 6 guineas per annum at the time of their death) to provide an annual dole of bread, cheese and beer to the poor every Easter. Henceforward, the lands were to be known as the Bread and Cheese Lands.\n\nHistory\nThe churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that \"on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and divers barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn\" was suspended on account of a visit from Charles Fotherby, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, owing to previous ceremonies having caused \"much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease\". In 1645, rector William Horner claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were glebe (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands. The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the Committee for Plundered Ministers, who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649. Horner brought the case before the Court of the Exchequer in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole. Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women \"who grew together in their bodies\", but do not give any name for the women.In 1681, the \"disorder and indecency\" of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church; it was moved to the church porch.By 1770, it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20 guineas (about \u00a33,100 in 2024), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year. By this time as well as the dole of bread, cheese and beer, hard bread rolls known as \"Biddenden cakes\", moulded into an image of the sisters, were thrown to crowds from the church roof. The Biddenden cakes were flat, hard and made of flour and water, and were described as \"not by any means tempting\"; one writer in 1860 described one as \"a biscuit plaque\".\n\nOrigins of the Biddenden Maids legend\nAlthough it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656, an anonymous article in The Gentleman's Magazine in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids. This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age. The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the \"Maids of Biddenden\". The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity. As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a broadside published in 1790. The Antiquarian Repertory of 1775 says that the sisters had lived \"as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago\". Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.\nHistorian Edward Hasted, in the third volume of The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been \"given by persons unknown\"). Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent \"two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction\". While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as \"a vulgar tradition\".Hasted's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian Robert Chambers, and the story was generally treated as a folk myth. A letter to the British Medical Journal in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500. The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins, particularly after Chang and Eng Bunker proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives. Notes and Queries magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents, the editors describing Hasted's conclusions as \"very obscure and unsatisfactory\" and questioning why the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\" should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston, but no significant research into the tradition was carried out.\n\nGrowth of the charity\nAs the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter, the first recorded mention of the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\", and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.\n\nIn the 1820s, a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector's pew in Biddenden church was the sisters' burial place. In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, \"attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity\". The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob. As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the workhouse, but the crowds continued to cause problems. In 1882 Biddenden's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.In 1900, antiquarian George Clinch investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of Mary I (1553\u20131558), a date roughly consistent with the \"two hundred and fifty years ago\" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the \"1100\" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read \"1500\", and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying \"the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one\". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be unleavened bread.\n\nBelief and scepticism\nIn almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a viable double fusion has ever been documented.Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed.  They are not, however, mentioned in any journals or books from the period.  This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617 \u2013 after 1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south-east England would have been widely noted.In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective.  He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.Jan Bondeson (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names \"Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst\" are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition, the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed.  Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the Chronicon Scotorum, the Annals of the Four Masters and the Annals of Clonmacnoise of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location.  He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible, and agreed with Ballantyne's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake.  He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the eighteenth century to fabricate the story.\n\nToday\nIn 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated with other local charities with similar purposes, to form the Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.The tradition of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.\n\nNotes and references\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nBiddenden Parish Council Archived 10 April 2012 at the Wayback Machine\nBiddenden cakes exhibited at London's Science Museum",

        "body": "Biscuit tins are utilitarian or decorative containers used to package and sell biscuits (such as those served during tea) and some confectionery. Invented by Huntley & Palmers in 1831, they are commonly found in households in Great Britain, Ireland, and Commonwealth countries, but also in continental Europe and French Canada. Popularity in the United States and English Canada spread later in the 20th century. Over 60% of UK households own a biscuit tin.Because of their attractive appearance, biscuit tins have often been used by charities and by some visitor attractions as fundraising devices since many customers will happily pay more for a tin of biscuits than it is worth.\n\nHistory\nBiscuit tins are steel cans made of tin plate. This consists of steel sheets thinly coated with tin. The sheets are then bent to shape. By about 1850, Great Britain had become the dominant world supplier of tin plate, through a combination of technical innovation and political control over most of the suppliers of tin ore. Biscuit tin manufacture was a small but prestigious part of the vast industry of tin plate production, which saw a huge increase in demand in the 19th century was directly related to the growing industrialisation of food production, by increasingly sophisticated methods of preservation and the requirements made by changing methods of distribution.\nThe British biscuit tin came about when the Licensed Grocer's Act 1861 allowed groceries to be individually packaged and sold. Coinciding with the removal of the duty on paper for printed labels, printing directly on to tinplate became common. The new process of offset lithography, patented in 1877, allowed multicoloured designs to be printed onto elaborately shaped tins.\n\nThe decorative biscuit tin was invented by Huntley & Palmers in 1831. A decorated biscuit tin was commissioned in 1868 by Huntley & Palmers from the London firm of De La Rue to a design by Owen Jones. Early methods of printing included the transfer process (essentially the method used to decorate porcelain and pottery since about 1750) and the direct lithographic process, which involved laying an inked stone directly on to a sheet of tin. Its disadvantage was that correct colour registration was difficult. The breakthrough in decorative tin plate production was the invention of the offset lithographic process. It consists of bringing a sheet of rubber into contact with the decorated stone, and then setting-off the impression so obtained upon the metal surface. The advantages over previous methods of printing were that any number of colours could be used, correctly positioned, and applied to an uneven surface if necessary. Thus the elaborately embossed, colourful designs that were such a feature of the late Victorian biscuit tin industry became technically possible.\nThe most exotic designs were produced in the early years of the 20th century, just prior to the First World War. In the 1920s and 1930s, costs had risen substantially and the design of biscuit tins tended to be more conservative, with the exception of the tins targeted at the Christmas market and intended to appeal primarily to children. The designs generally reflected popular interests and tastes.\nThe advent of the Second World War stopped all production of decorative tin ware and after it ended in 1945, the custom did not enjoy the same popularity as before.\nVintage biscuit tins can be found in various museums and on the market have become collector items.\n\nWorks of art for the home\nBiscuit tins have always been more than just containers. The manufacturers aimed to make products which would be enjoyed beyond the life span of the biscuits themselves.\nTins shaped like actual objects began to be made in the late 1890s. The earlier tins were shaped like baskets but gradually a whole range of fine art objects appeared. Biscuit tins were no longer aimed merely at children at the Christmas market. They had become useful and decorative parts of the middle class home.\nReplicas of Chinese vases could be used as such when the biscuits had been eaten. Boxes imitating porcelain, Wedgwood china or fine wooden boxes mimicked the wonderful objects found in grand houses or in museums.\nThe First World War saw a break in the supply of decorated biscuit tins. Many manufacturers hesitated to resume production of \"fancy\" tins once the restrictions had been lifted. Children however had a strong influence on the market and ensured the survival of well designed, elaborately shaped tins.\n\nShop biscuit tins\nBritish biscuit manufacturers supplied grocer's shops with biscuits packed into large tins, typically containing seven pounds (3.2 kilogrammes). These would be displayed in the shop, and the shopkeeper would weigh out the required amount of biscuits into a paper bag for each customer. Some tins had a glass panel in the lid, so that customers could see the biscuits inside.\n\nSee also\nDecorative box\nCan collecting\nGround biscuit, ground form of biscuit\nCookie jar\nRich tea, an early form of biscuit\nTea caddy\nTin box\nSteel and tin cans\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n Media related to Biscuit tins at Wikimedia Commons",

The business was started online in 2007 by husband and wife team Harriet Hastings and Stevie Congdon, delivering to both the UK and internationally. Biscuiteers also offers a bespoke and corporate service. The company was in the Real Business top 50 in 2011 and was named as one of the Accelerate 250 fastest growing British companies of 2013.  Biscuiteers iced more than 2 million biscuits and dispatched to over 100 countries in 2018.  All of the biscuits are made in their kitchens in London.\n\nHistory\nHarriet Hastings co-founded Biscuiteers with her husband, Stevie Congdon in 2007. Hastings had just left her job as Director of Consumer Brands at Trimedia following the birth of her fourth child and was keen to create her own e-commerce brand. She saw an opportunity in food gifting in the UK and developed the idea of iced biscuits for their flexibility in design, shelf life and postability. Biscuiteers launched with a small range of designs called collections like the fashion world.  For the first 5 years the brand sold online at Biscuiteers.com and to corporate and wholesale clients including Selfridges and Harrods. In 2012 the business opened their first Icing Caf\u00e9 in Notting Hill, and their second Icing Caf\u00e9 on the Northcote Road followed in 2014. In September 2017, the brand celebrated their 10th birthday with London's very first 'biscuit exhibition' at the Serpentine Gallery, a retrospective look at the company's past decade, represented by 10 intricate, 3D biscuit structures made from biscuit.\n\nProducts\nBiscuiteers receive corporate commissions such as logos and other designs for iced biscuits and cakes and have previously created bespoke biscuits for Anya Hindmarch, Mulberry, Boden, Swatch, Dior, Cartier, Gucci, Red Bull and Burberry among others, where they want very accurate representations of their designs. They also have a bespoke service for private parties, weddings, christenings, baby showers and birthday parties.\nBiscuiteers products are stocked in Selfridges, Fenwicks, Harvey Nichols, Le Bon Marche and Saint Laurent in Paris amongst others.\nIn Summer 2019, Biscuiteers unveiled a new purpose-built space in the Wimbledon district of London. The new manufacturing unit and office reflects the creativity and dedication to design for which Biscuiteers is so well known.\n\nIcing Cafes\nThe \u201cBiscuiteers Boutique & Icing Caf\u00e9\u201d on Kensington Park Road, Notting Hill opened its doors in 2012 and the companies second site opened on the Northcote Road in Battersea in 2014. The Icing Cafes have been named as one of 'London's quirkiest cafes' by the Telegraph and included in Vogue 'The Most Instagrammable Places in London' roundup\n\nBiscuiteers Books\nBiscuiteers first book, \u201cBiscuiteers Book of Iced Biscuits\u201d by Harriet Hastings and Sarah Moore was published by Kyle Books in 2012. Their second book, \u201cBiscuiteers Book of Iced Gifts\u201d by Harriet Hastings was published by Michael Joseph (Publisher) in 2018.\n\nCrowdfunding\nIn October 2016 Biscuiteers embarked on a round of crowdfunding with crowdfunding platform Crowdcube. In total the business raised a total of \u00a31.2 million. During the crowdfunding process the Biscuiteers were awarded a top score of three gold medals from independent crowdfunding guide Crowdrating. This identified Biscuiteers as a strong investment opportunity.\n\n\n== References ==",

Car\u00eame's variations on the basic recipe are made with citron, aniseed, orange flower, lemon peel, raisins, vanilla, chestnuts, and even some versions made with cheeses like gruyere and brie. The \"Anglo-Francais\" version is made with citron, raisins and Jamaican rum.In the Livre de Cuisine recipe by Jules Gouff\u00e9 (translated into English by Alphonse Gouffe, head pastry chef to Queen Victoria) the pastry was prepared with similar ingredients and shaped into a two-inch thick round loaf. The edges were scored and a pattern cut on top and tied around the edge with buttered parchment to control spread in the oven. Small cakes made this way were a breakfast food.\n\nPreparation\nG\u00e2teau de plomb is made by rubbing butter into flour to obtain a crumbly mixture used to form a sweet paste with sugar, eggs and cream added. It can be scored and baked as one large roll, tied with parchment to retain its shape, or formed into small cakes.\n\nIn popular culture\nFrances Milton Trollope, in the 19th-century Victorian novel Second Love, Or, Beauty and Intellect, wrote:\n\"The three brothers were all military men. The eldest, as the declared heir of both father and mother, was a great gentleman, and favored, as is usual in such cases, with one of those easy and pleasant little staff appointments which may be considered as the sugarplums in that honorable g\u00e2teau de plomb, a soldier's life.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

Variations exist which substitute or add ingredients to cater to different tastes, dietary requirements or ingredient availability.\n\nHistory\nCaramel shortbread is an adapted form of the original Scottish shortbread. Scottish shortbread originated around the 12th century, but its modern refined form is attributed to the efforts of Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century.The practice of adding additional topping or ingredients to shortbread to create unique variations dates back to at least the 19th century when candied orange peel and almonds were added. Where and when the combination of caramel and shortbread first appeared or was popularised is not known. \nCombinations of shortbread with caramel topping dates to at least the early 1950s.\nA recipe for Chocolate Caramel Crunch (Millionaires' Shortbread), with a caramel layer and chocolate top coat, was published in the Scottish Association of Young Farmers' Clubs book 'Recipes' in 1972.  The recipes in this book were contributed by Scottish members of the organisation.\nRecipes for the dish with a chocolate topping also appeared in Australia in the early 1970s in the Australian Women\u2019s Weekly. The earliest of these recipes appears in 1970 in an issue of The Australian Women's Weekly under the name \u2018Caramel Shortbread\u2019, but this version lacks the distinctive chocolate topping. Later recipes such as one from 1981 include the chocolate layer.The treat is still commonly associated with the cuisines of Australian, New Zealand and Scotland (as well as British cuisine more generally) and is still consumed in these countries regularly. In Scotland it is often served to the first visitor to a house on New Year's Day.\nIt is also consumed around the world, where it is known by different names. In 2018 the dessert was featured in an episode of the American television show America's Test Kitchen.\n\nNaming\nThe name of the dessert varies by different regions and has varied throughout its history. This includes  the aforementioned names of caramel shortbread and chocolate caramel shortbread, as well as millionaire's shortbread, caramel slice, caramel squares, or millionaire's slice.\nThe name \"millionaire's shortbread\" appears to  have originated in Scotland. The \"millionaire\" prefix to millionaire's shortbread or millionaires slice implies a level of decadence and wealth to the sweet treat, that it is an upgrade from regular shortbread.\n\nVariations\nMany different variations of caramel shortbread exist to cater to different tastes, dietary requirements, and ingredient availability.\nSome variants include using white rather than milk chocolate for the topping, adding espresso and hazelnut, substituting shortbread for  Anzac biscuits, adding raisins to the shortbread, or topping with peanut butter instead of chocolate. Some recipes adjust the recipe to cater to dietary requirements.

        "body": "A Cornish fairing is a type of traditional ginger biscuit commonly found in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. \"Fairing\" was originally a term for an edible treat sold at fairs around the country, though over time the name has become associated with ginger biscuits or gingerbread, which were given as a treat to children or by men to their sweethearts. In Cornwall, fairings contained ginger and became famous around the country when a Cornish manufacturer started selling them by mail order in 1886. The same manufacturer still makes them and the company has recently teamed up with celebrity chef Rick Stein to make biscuits.\n\nDescription\nCornish fairings are sweet and spicy ginger biscuits, made with standard biscuit ingredients such as flour, caster sugar and butter, together with mixed spice, ginger, cinnamon and golden syrup. They are roughly circular and brittle similar to gingerbread. They are created by mixing the dry ingredients with butter, until the mixture resembles bread crumbs, then adding the sugar and syrup before forming the biscuits and baking high in the oven, followed by a period at the bottom of the oven.\n\nHistory\n\"Fairings\" was originally the common name for edible souvenirs sold at fairs around England. Fairings would vary throughout the country: at Bartholomew Fair in Smithfield, fairings of gingerbread were sold from 1126 to 1800; in the northern counties, a traditional fairing would be a decorated \"paste egg\" at Easter.  The Cornish version included the spiced ginger biscuit which became famous in Victorian times. The complete fairing from Cornwall would include the ginger biscuit, along with almond and caraway comfits (colloquially \"lambs' tails\" \u2013 actually sugar-coated almonds and caraway seeds), crystallised angelica and macaroons.During the 1800s, the biscuits became a treat that young men from the middle or lower classes would buy as a treat for their sweetheart. Previously, the spices required to create the biscuits were exclusive to the wealthy classes, who used them to make cakes. A number of manufacturers started making ginger biscuits called \"fairings\" all over England. One example of this was in Grasmere, where the gingerbread sold as fairings was so popular that William Wordsworth's sister Dorothy wrote in one of her journals that she and her brother both craved them. In 1875, John Cooper Furniss obtained a large store in East Bridge Street, Truro, and premises on Duchy Wharf and installed ovens for biscuit manufacturing. He introduced several new kinds of biscuits and also a penny box of sweetmeats with every box containing a small piece of jewellery. Needless to say, these were very successful and in great demand. In 1886, John Cooper Furniss started selling the ginger biscuits at his tea room in Truro, Cornwall, baking them in his Truro bakery. They were so popular that he started selling them via mail-order. The recipe Furniss used is thought to have originated from a \"maid-hiring\" fair which used to take place during the week after Christmas, in Launceston, Cornwall although Furniss Foods suggest the recipe came from the fairs held at Whitsuntide or Corpus Christi.Furniss went on to expand his company to Furniss Foods, a well-known Cornish biscuit manufacturer, which created a number of different fairing varieties, such as \"orange and lemon\" or \"apple and cinnamon\". He also established a Charitable Trust which is still in operation today. It is limited to the parish of Truro to provide assistance to residents in need who use coal as the primary source of heat. The company moved to a larger factory in 1988, but ran into financial difficulties during the 2000s and it was bought by Proper Cornish, a pasty manufacturer, which focused the company's production on the Cornish fairings and a couple of other lines.Cornish foods are an essential element in the county's touristic appeal, with a survey by South West tourism showing food as one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall. During an interview where he was launching a new line of biscuits, celebrity chef Rick Stein explained that he associated fairings with his childhood.\n\n\"When I was a child, we never left Cornwall without a couple of tins of Furniss Cornish Fairings. They were as important to us as clotted cream and pasties.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Crawford's is a brand of biscuits.\nIt started as a Scottish baker of ship's biscuits in a public house on The Shore, Leith in 1813.  The bakery was acquired by Robert Mathie in 1817 and then William Crawford in 1856, when Mathie retired.  William Crawford & Sons established large factories in Leith and Liverpool so that, at its peak, it was one of Britain's largest biscuit manufacturers and claimed to be its oldest.  The company was acquired by United Biscuits in 1960 and is now a brand within their portfolio.\n\nHistory\nIn 1856, William Crawford (1818\u20131889) bought an established bakery at 31 The Shore, Leith from Robert Mathie (1789\u20131863). The bakery specialised in ships' biscuits and had been established in 1813, with Mathie taking it over in 1817.Crawford wished to expand the business and set up a retail outlet at 14 Leith Street (which links Leith Walk to Princes Street) in 1861, relocating to the exclusive address of 2 Princes Street in 1866. In 1879 they built a large purpose built factory on Elbe Street in Leith. The Elbe Street factory was served by its own railway siding. A second factory premises was built in Leith on Anderson Place in 1947 (it is now in use as a creative hub).William's eldest son, William Crawford (1858\u20131926), became a partner of the business in 1880 and expanded it further. It was then known as Crawford and Sons.In 1897, two younger brothers, Archibald Inglis Crawford and James Shields Russel Crawford, were sent to establish a subsidiary in Australia.  They got as far as the major English port of Liverpool in England where they established a major new factory.\nThis huge factory, the Fairfield Works, stands on Binns Road and was designed by their brother, the architect Alexander Hunter Crawford in 1895, taking two years to build. The Liverpool factory was highly mechanised, allowing creation of more elaborate biscuit designs, in particular the Custard cream which promptly became one of Britain's most popular biscuits. The Fairfield factory made snack bars including Bandits, Penguin, and 54321 chocolate.\nIn 1927 Crawfords were one of the first factories to provide employees with their own social club and sports facilities: at Sandown Hall in nearby Wavertree.In 1938, Crawford's carried out the first ever British national biscuit survey, interviewing approximately 5,000 households.United Biscuits, formed in 1948 from two Scottish companies, MacFarlane Lang and McVitie & Price, acquired  William Crawford & Sons in 1960 for \u00a36 million.Production processes were automated in the 1960s.The Elbe Street factory was expanded and modernised in the 1950s but demolished in the 1990s when housing in Leith's former industrial areas started to change the area. Around 200 people lost their jobs.\nThe closure in 1996 was cited as a casualty in the Scottish \"bread wars\".McVities have struggled to maintain the Scottish factories for their iconic Scottish brands.\n\nProducts\nIn 1923, the company advertised several biscuit varieties which commemorated royalty and its marriages:\nYork \u2013 the marriage of the Duke of York to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon\nWedding Bells \u2013 the marriage of Princess Mary to Viscount Lascelles\nMarie \u2013 the marriage of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia to the Duke of Edinburgh\nRoyal GeorgeTheir range then included a variety of popular biscuits including shortbread, cream crackers, digestives and ginger nuts.\nThe brand now includes:\n\nBourbon creams\nCream crackers\nCustard creams\nDigestives\nGaribaldi biscuits\nMarie biscuits\n\"Nice\" biscuits\n\nPackaging\nHistorically, some of Crawford's biscuits were sold in decorative biscuit tins. In 2007, a Crawford biscuit tin was sold for \u00a315,600 at Bonhams in the form of a sports car and was reported to be the most expensive tin sold until that date.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCrawfords Biscuits at Brighton Toy Museum, with images of biscuit tins, model Crawford's Biscuits railway wagons, etc.",

        "body": "Cujuelle de Calenzana are biscuits popular in Calenzana, Corsica. In other parts of Corsica, they are known as canistrelli or cocciole, but these are all fundamentally the same product. The biscuits are made with local raw materials, including white wine from the Patrimonio vineyards, sugar, flour and oil. Cujuelle are typically rhomboid (diamond-shaped), and come in several flavor varieties including almond, anise, lemon and chocolate. They are typically consumed by dunking in milk or muscat wine.\n\nHistory\nCujuelle biscuits have been produced commercially in an artisanal factory in Calenzana since 1984. A similar product, Cujuelle de Zilla, began production in 1997. The recipe has remained the same since the factories' founding. Little is known of the history of the recipe prior to that.\n\nEvolution\nOver the course of the years, many variations of the basic product have been invented, with some ingredients added and others left behind. For example, some varieties leave out the white wine and other varieties include ingredients such as chocolate chips, raisins and nuts, and consequently change the name of the product. For example, the variant that includes nuts is called biscuits aux noisettes [biscuits with peanuts], while another variant is named biscuits avec raisins, noisettes et amandes [biscuits with raisins, peanuts and almonds], while a third is named Canestrelli a l'Anis [canestrelli with anise].\n\nProducers\nPresently, several brands sell cujuelle biscuits. The main producers are Christian Perrin and Franck Dupr\u00e9, both local bakers operating out of the Haute-Corse region. Perrin runs a small bakeshop in Calenzana, while Perrin runs a farm in the district and produces the cujuelle as a side business.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A custard cream is a type of sandwich biscuit popular in the British Isles filled with a creamy, custard-flavoured centre. Traditionally, the filling was buttercream (which is still used in most home-made recipes) but nowadays cheaper fats have replaced butter in mass-produced biscuits. The filling tastes of vanilla and as such is more akin to the taste of custard made with custard powder than egg custard. It is believed that the custard cream biscuit originated in Britain in 1908. Usually, they have an elaborate baroque design stamped onto them, originating in the Victorian era and representing ferns.Some British and Irish supermarkets produce their own brand versions, with variations including lemon, orange, chocolate, strawberry, coffee, tangerine, rhubarb & custard and coconut flavours. There is a digestive cream version available, in which the biscuit is replaced with a digestive biscuit. In a 2007 poll of 7,000 Britons, 9 out of 10 voted custard creams to be their favourite biscuit. In 2009 it was ranked the eighth most popular biscuit in the UK to dunk into tea. In the same year, a study by Mindlab International listed custard creams as the most likely biscuit to cause injury or harm, scoring a so-called \"risk rating\" of 5.64. Custard creams featured in the 2022 film Thirteen Lives, as the favourite snack of British cave rescuers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A dog biscuit is a hard, biscuit-based, dietary supplement for dogs or other canines, similar to human snack food.\nDog biscuits tend to be hard and dry, often sold in a flat bone-shape. The dry and hard biscuit texture helps clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health.\n\nHistory\n\"Dog's bread\", made from bran, has been mentioned since at least Roman times. It was already criticized (as in later centuries) as particularly bad bread; Juvenal refers to dog's bread as \"filth\" - \"And bit into the filth of a dog's bread\" Et farris sordes mordere Canini.In Spain, \"pan de perro\" is mentioned as early as 1623 in a play by Lope de Vega. It is used here in the sense of giving someone blows; to \"give dog's bread\" to someone could mean anything from mistreating them to killing them. The latter meaning refers to a special bread (also called zarazas) made with ground glass, poison and needles and intended to kill dogs.The bread meant as food for dogs was also called parruna and was made from bran. This was very likely what was referred to in associating the bread with (non-fatal) mistreatment.\nIn France, Charles Estienne wrote in 1598: \"Take no notice of bran bread,... it is better to leave it for the hunting, or shepherd, or watch dogs.\" By the nineteenth century, \"pain de chien\" had become a way of referring to very bad bread: \"It is awful, general, they give us dog's bread!\"The English dog biscuit appears to be a nineteenth-century innovation: \"With this may be joined farinaceous and vegetable articles \u2014 oat-meal, fine-pollard, dog-biscuit, potatoes, carrots, parsnips\" (1827); \"being in the neighbourhood of Maidenhead, I inspected Mr. Smith's dog-biscuit manufactory, and was surprised to find he has been for a long period manufacturing the enormous quantity of five tons a-week !\" (1828)\nIn the south of England it is much the fashion to give sporting-dogs a food called dog-biscuit instead of barley-meal, and the consequences resulting from this simple aliment are most gratifying. Barley-meal, indeed, is an unnatural food, unless it be varied with bones, for a dog delights to gnaw, and thus to exercise those potent teeth with which nature has furnished him ; his stomach, too, is. designed to digest the hard and tough integument of animal substance; hence, barleymeal, as a principal portion of his subsistence, is by no means to be desired. In small private families it is not always possible to obtain a sufficiency of meat and bones for the sustenance of a dog, and recourse is too frequently had to a coarse and filthy aliment, which is highly objectionable, especially if the creature be debarred from taking daily exercise, fettered by a chain, and restricted, by situation, from obtaining access to grass ; and no one who has not watched the habits of our faithful allies (as we have done), can be aware of the absolute necessity which exists for his obtaining a constant supply of it. If no other good effect resulted from it than the sleekness of his coat and clearness of his skin, these benefits ought to the procured for him; but when his health and comfort are to be also ensured, who, that has a grain of benevolence in his disposition, would hesitate to perform so simple and gratifying an act of duty?\nDog-biscuit is a hard and well-baked mass of coarse, yet clean and wholesome flour, of an inferior kind to that known as sailors' biscuit; and this latter substance, indeed, would be the best substitute for the former with which we are acquainted. A bag of dog-biscuit of five shillings' value, will be an ample supply for a yard-dog during the year: it should be soaked in water, or \" pot liquor,\" for an hour or two ; and if no meat be at hand, a little dripping or lard may be added to it while softening, which will make a relishing meal at a trifling cost. We have for many years known the utility of the plan thus advocated, and we earnestly recommend all who value the safety of the community and their own (to say nothing of the happiness of the canine race), to make trial of the rational and feasible plan which we have detailed.\" (1841)\nIn later years, dog biscuits began to be made of meat products and were sometimes treated as synonymous with dog food. In 1871, an ad appeared in Cassell's Illustrated Almanac for \"SLATER'S MEAT BISCUIT FOR DOGS - Contains vegetable substances and about 25 per cent of Prepared Meat. It gives Dogs endurance, and without any other food will keep them in fine working condition.\"In England, Spratt's Dog Biscuits not only obtained a patent but seems to have claimed to have invented the food:\n\nBy most accounts, the history of the industry begins with a man named James Spratt. An electrician from Cincinnati, Spratt had patented a new type of lightning conductor in 1850. Later in the decade, he traveled to England to sell it. According to industry lore, he had a quayside epiphany in London when he saw a group of dogs eating discarded hardtack, the cheap, tough biscuits carried on ships and known to sailors as \"molar breakers.\" The first major chunk of today's pet industry was born.\nIn 1860, still in England, Spratt unveiled Spratt's Patent Meat Fibrine Dog Cakes, a combination of wheat, beetroot, vegetables, and beef blood. Before long, he had competitors with names like Dr. A. C. Daniels' Medicated Dog Bread and F. H. Bennett's Malatoid Dog Biscuits. The products embraced the dubious science and the lightly regulated hucksterism of their era. (2009)\nMore than 70 years ago, in a little shop in London an electrician named James Spratt conducted experiments which led to the production of Spratt's Patent\u2014a scientifically blended dog food. It was the first attempt to lift the dog out of the class of scavenger which he had occupied from caveman times. The market was untouched, and in those early days, Spratt's Patent secured a bull-dog grip on it that it has never relinquished, despite the fact that in the past seventy years many competitors have tried to wrest the leadership from them.  (1920)\nIn at least one case (in 1886) Spratt sued a seller accused of substituting another product - an early example of a company fighting \"knock-offs\":\n\nSpratt's Dog Biscuits.\nOn Wednesday last, in the Quean's Bench Division of the High Court, before Lord Coleridge and a special jury. Spratt's Patent Company claimed an injunction against a Mr. Warnett, a general dealer at St. Albans, who, they alleged, was selling as theirs certain meat biscuits for dogs not of their manufacture. They also asked for an account of profits, and damages and costs.\nThe case for the plaintiffs was that for many years they and their predecessor, James Spratt, had manufactured and sold, under patents of 1868 and 1881, meat biscuits for feeding dogs, the full name or description of which is \" Spratt's Patent Meat Fibrine Dog Cakes,\" but which are often designated by them, and are commonly known in the trade, as \" Spratt's Fibrine Biscuits,\" or \" Spratt's Dog Biscuits,\" or \" Spratt's Dog Cakes,\" or \" Spratt's Meat Biscuits,\" or \" Spratt's Patent Biscuits,\" or \" Patent Dog Biscuits,\" all which, as the plaintiffs asserted, indicated biscuits of their manufacture and no other. These biscuits are made in a square form, and each is stamped with the words \" Spratt's Patent\" and with a + in the centre. It was alleged that \" the biscuits have been found most valuable as food for dogs, and have acquired a great reputation.\" They are in large demand, and the plaintiffs make considerable profits from the sale thereof, which profits would be considerably larger but that, as they alleged, fraudulent imitations are frequently palmed off upon the public as the biscuits of the plaintiffs, and then it was charged that the defendant had, in fraud of the plaintiffs and of the public, \" been selling to the public, as genuine dog biscuits of the plaintiffs' manufacture, biscuits which are not of the plaintiffs' manufacture, but are a fraudulent imitation thereof as to shape and appearance, and which do not contain the ingredients of the plaintiffs' biscuits.\" Then several instances were stated in which persons who sent to the shop of the defendant to ask for Spratt's dog biscuits received other biscuits similar, as was alleged, to the plaintiffs' in size, appearance, and weight, the only difference being that, in lieu of the words \" Spratt's Patent \" and the cross, the biscuits sold were stamped with a hexagon and the words \" American meat.\"\n\nMr. Horton Smith, Q.C., in opening the case for the plaintiffs, said that, suspecting that their biscuits were being pirated by the defendant, they adopted the usual course of sending persons to his shop to ask for Spratt's dog biscuits, and in every instance Benton's American meat biscuits, which were similar in shape, size, and general character, were delivered. (April 10, 1886)\nSpratt lost in this case and the judge regretted that he could not grant the defendant court costs.\nAt one point after this, as an industrial product, dog biscuits were classified in the same category as soap: \"Of the making of dog biscuits, which the census places in the same category with soap, as using animal refuse from which soap grease has been extracted, it is unnecessary to say much.\"\nSpratt dominated the American market until 1907, when F. H. Bennett, whose own dog biscuits were faring poorly against those of the larger company, had the idea of making them in the shape of a bone. \"His 'Maltoid Milk-Bones' were such a success that for the next fifteen years Bennett's Milk-Bone dominated the commercial dog food market in America.\" In 1931, the National Biscuit Company, now known as Nabisco, bought the company.\n\nWorld's largest dog biscuit\nThe world's largest dog biscuit weighs 279.87 kg and was baked to be 2,000 times larger than average by Hampshire Pet Products from Joplin, Missouri, US.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "To dunk or to dip a biscuit or some other food, usually baked goods, means to submerge it into a drink, especially tea, coffee, or milk. Dunking releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Dunking can be used to melt chocolate on biscuits to create a richer flavour.\nDunking is a popular way of enjoying biscuits in many countries. A popular form of dunking in Australia is the \"Tim Tam Slam\",  also known as 'tea sucking'. The physics of dunking is driven by the porosity of the biscuit and the surface tension of the beverage. A biscuit is porous and, when dunked, capillary action draws the liquid into the interstices between the crumbs.Dunking is first reported with ancient Romans softening their hard unleavened wafers (Latin: bis coctum \u2013 \"twice baked\") in wine. Modern day dunking has its roots in naval history when, in the 16th century, biscuits known as \"hard tack\" were on board Royal Navy ships, which were so hard that the British sailors would dunk them in beer in order to soften them up. The most popular biscuit to dunk in tea in the United Kingdom is McVitie's chocolate digestive. In the US, Oreos are frequently dunked in milk, while the Dunkin' Donuts franchise is named for the practice of dunking doughnuts into coffee. In South Africa and in India, rusks are a popular food for dunking in both tea and coffee. In the Netherlands, stroopwafels are commonly dunked in tea or coffee, often after having been set on above the hot drink for a few minutes to melt the caramel inside. In Nigeria, bread is commonly dunked in tea or hot chocolate, while Acaraj\u00e9 is dunked in pap.  In Australia and New Zealand gingernut biscuits are commonly dunked in tea or coffee. most commonly these are Arnotts brand Ginger Nuts.\nDunking is also used as a slang term for intinction: the Eucharistic practice of partly dipping the consecrated bread, or host, into the consecrated wine, by the officiant before distributing.\n\nEtiquette and style\nWhile modern day dunking has its origins in 16th century naval history, it wasn't until the 19th century and the emergence of afternoon tea in the early Victorian era that Great Britain began to regard biscuits as something to be dunked in tea, a British custom that was later exported around the globe. Different cultures have different attitudes toward biscuit dunking. Historically in British high society, dunking was frowned upon and generally seen as children's or working class fashion. However, Queen Victoria herself was said to enjoy dunking her biscuits, a German custom from her younger days. In 2007, a tea room in Brighton, England, banned dunking on its premises.In the United States, the act took on a marketing purpose for doughnut sellers in the 1930s. They formed the National Dunking Association, which prompted members to follow \"rules for dunking\" and used the association to market their products.\n\nScience\nPhysicist Len Fisher of the University of Bristol presented some light-hearted discussion of dunking on \"National Biscuit Dunking Day\" in the UK, as part of an attempt to make physics accessible. Fisher appeared to be somewhat taken aback by the large amount of media attention, ascribing it to a \"hunger for accessible science\".  Fisher also described his astonishment at journalists' interest in one equation used in the field: Washburn's equation, which describes capillary flow in porous materials.  Writing in Nature, he says \"the equation was published in almost every major UK newspaper.  The journalists who published it took great care to get it right, some telephoning several times to check\". Fisher was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for Physics, in 1999, for his research into biscuit dunking.In 2012, Michelin-starred English restaurateur Heston Blumenthal researched the effect of dunking chocolate biscuits, and concluded that it improved the biscuit's taste. \"If you have chocolate on one side, if it melts a bit, you get a velvety smooth texture and then the delicious flavour as a result.\"In 2022, a comparative study concluded that a hobnob style biscuit maintains its integrity for the longest after being dunked in a hot drink.\n\nSee also\nDipping sauce\nSop\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Food dunking at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "A flapjack (also known as a cereal bar, oat bar or oat slice) is a baked bar, cooked in a flat oven tin and cut into squares or rectangles, made from rolled oats, fat (typically butter), brown sugar and usually golden syrup.The snack is similar to the North American granola bar.\n\nVarieties\nAs well as being baked at home, they are widely available in shops, ready-packaged, often with extra ingredients such as chocolate, dried fruit such as glace cherries, nuts, yoghurt and toffee pieces or coatings, either as individual servings or full unsliced trayfuls. Some flapjacks may contain maple syrup. They are usually an alternative to a biscuit or cake, and textures range from soft and moist to dry and crisp. Because of the high levels of fat and calories in traditional recipes, some \"diet\" versions are available with lower fat and calorie content.\n\nHistory\nThe Oxford English Dictionary records the word \"flapjack\" being used as early as the beginning of the 16th century, although at this time it seems to have been a flat tart. Shakespeare refers to \"flap-jacks\" in Pericles, Prince of Tyre, but this is one of the many anachronisms in his historical plays and does not suggest that he thought it was a middle eastern dish, merely a common English dessert of the time:\n\n\"Come, thou shant go home, and we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks, and thou shalt be welcome.\"\nAct II Scene ILater, flapjack would be used to describe something similar to an apple flan, but it is not until 1935 that the word is first used to describe a food made of oats. In the United Kingdom, this usage has mostly superseded earlier recipes.\n\nName\nThe food is called a flapjack in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and Newfoundland.  In other English-speaking countries, the same item is called by different names, such as cereal bar, oat bar or (in Australia and New Zealand) oat slice.\nIn the United States and Canada, \"flapjack\" is a widely-known but lesser-used term for pancake.\n\nSee also\nParkin (cake)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Funeral biscuits were a type of biscuit traditionally served at funerals in England, Wales, Scotland, and North America.\nThe Gentleman's Magazine described funeral biscuits in 1790. The writer described them as \"a kind of sugared biscuit, which are wrapped up, generally two of them together, in a sheet of wax paper, sealed with black wax.\" The biscuits were given to each person attending the funeral, and were a custom of the funerals of \"lower and the middling class of people.\" In Lincolnshire, funeral biscuits were part of the tradition of telling the bees of their owner's death in the early 19th century.In early North America, the biscuits were stamped with burial motifs or symbols, such as a winged head or cherub, or an hourglass or skull.\nThroughout the 19th century, British newspapers carried advertisements for commercially-prepared biscuits. Prepared biscuits were common in the period; a story printed in an 1877 edition of the Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine noted,  \nThe world must go round as usual, and folks must eat and drink even when their nearest and best are lying low. The manufacture of funeral biscuits is, we are all aware, quite a flourishing concern. \nBy the late Victorian period, the phrase \"lady fingers\" was used in some places interchangeably with funeral biscuits. An 1897 article in the New York Times noted, \"The American fashion of serving 'lady fingers' at afternoon tea is said to be a source of some surprise to English people, for the little cakes are generally known in England as 'funeral biscuits,' and are served in rural districts to the mourners after their drive to the cemetery. Similarly, an 1893 article in the New Orleans Daily Picayune noted, \nLadyfingers are served in all parts of England, with light refreshments, at funerals, and usually go by the name of 'funeral biscuits.' In the Yorkshire Dales, if you are asked to a funeral and are unable to attend, they usually send you, with a memorial card, a piece of spongecake and several ladyfingers folded in a sheet of black-bordered paper and fastened with big, black seals.The tradition of funeral biscuits continued in Wales into the early 20th century:In some places it is the custom to send to the friends of a family, after a death, a bag of biscuits with the card of the deceased. These funeral biscuits - often small, round sponge cakes - were known as arvel bread - arvel meaning ale. When arvel bread is passed around at a funeral each guest is expected to put a shilling on the plate.\n\nSee also\nDead-cakes\nLadyfinger\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nFuneral food, by Alison Petch\nModern recipe for Vaucluse House funeral biscuits",

They have a golden brown, glazed exterior and a moderately sweet pastry, but their defining characteristic is the layer of squashed fruit which gives rise to the colloquial names fly sandwiches, flies' graveyards, dead fly biscuits,, squashed fly biscuits, or in New Zealand, fly traps, because the squashed fruit resemble squashed flies.\n\nHistory\nThe Garibaldi biscuit was named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, the famous Italian general, revolutionary and leader of the struggle to unify the Kingdom of Italy, which finally was achieved in 1861.  Garibaldi made a popular visit to South Shields in England in 1854. The biscuit was first manufactured by the Bermondsey biscuit company Peek Freans in 1861 following the recruitment of Jonathan Carr, one of the great biscuit makers of Carlisle. In the United States, the Sunshine Biscuit Company for many years made a popular version of the Garibaldi with raisins which it called \"Golden Fruit\". Sunshine was bought out by the Keebler Company which briefly expanded the line to include versions filled with other fruits. The entire Golden Fruit product line was discontinued when the Keebler company became a division of Kellogg's in 2001.Varieties covered with plain or milk chocolate have also been marketed in the past, but appear not to have been available for many years.\n\nSee also\nFlies' graveyard\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "A kwarezimal (Maltese: kware\u017cimal; from Italian  Quaresima 'Lent') is a traditional Maltese biscuit, usually baked during Lent. It contains flour, sugar, orange rind and ground almonds (intrita). They are vegan, since they contain no animal protein, eggs, or dairy products.\nTradition holds that the kwarezimal was developed by the Knights of Malta. At the time, sugar was not restricted during Lent as it often is in modern practice, but rather considered a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities.\nIn medieval Europe, animal products were to be avoided during times of penance. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, but that did not mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against moderate drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days were popular occasions for serving food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways: fish could be molded to look like venison and imitation eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish roe and almond milk and cooking on coals.\n\nHistory\nAccording to lore, and many Bible scholars, St Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked off the coast of Malta in 60 A.D. on his way to Rome to face trial, and swam safely ashore. St Paul is also said to have introduced Christianity to Malta, making it one of the earliest outposts of the faith.\nThe era of the Knights of St John reinforced the islands\u2019 Christian tradition, and Maltese culture and social life are heavily influenced by its faith (the islands are 98 percent Roman Catholic). Church attendance in Malta is among the highest in Europe, although it is declining. Many traditional Maltese sweets and pastries are only available at certain times of the year, bound to the Catholic liturgical calendar\u2014such as kware\u017cimal.\nKware\u017cimal are a kind of chewy biscuit made with spices and ground almonds, a humble recipe originally made without eggs or butter, because during Lent, abstaining from eating animal products or animal meat was considered a penance. (Sugar was not taboo because it was considered a spice and therefore savory.) The word kware\u017cimal stems from the Italian word quarezima, referring to the 40 days of Lent fasting.\n\n\n== References ==",

Traditionally eaten at Christmas, they are also eaten at other times, sometimes with crema catalana or ice cream.\n\nOrigin\nThe noun neula comes from the Latin nebula, meaning \"fog\", referring to the biscuit's fine and light texture. Some documents show that neules existed before torr\u00f3, and torr\u00f3 has been shown to exist at least in the Middle Ages and was eaten, for example, at Jaume I's daughter's wedding.\n\nProduction\nMaking neules at home is not easy  because of their lightness and slimness, so they are usually bought by Catalonians in professional patisseries.\n\nOther products\nIn Belgium there are gaufres that, even though they are much thicker and flat, have the same origin as neules. The same origin have other some stuffed or not waffles, as Dutch stroopwafels. In other regions of Spain there are a sort of rolled biscuits called \"barquillos\", but they are very much stronger, harder and thicker than waffles and neules, bigger than neules and they taste different.\n\nSee also\nCatalan cuisine\nPirouline\n\n\n== References ==",

It is often served as an accompaniment to hot drinks, such as tea. The name probably derives from the town of Nice in the south of France. 1929 editions of the Hull Daily Mail carried an advertisement for Huntley & Palmers Nice Biscuits using the phrase \"Delightful as the town after which they are named\", indicating that by this point their manufacturers intended the public to associate the biscuit with the French city, whether or not that had been the intended pronunciation.A Nice biscuit was listed in an Army and Navy Co-operative Society price list in 1895. The British company Huntley & Palmers made a Nice biscuit as early as 1904. The Australian company Arnott's Biscuits also claims to have invented the Nice biscuit. Nice biscuits are sold by various companies under different brand names in most of the British Commonwealth as well as other countries.\nThe Dutch biscuit maker Verkade claims its Nizza version (introduced in 1910) is the Netherlands' \"most beloved cookie\", and in 2010 celebrated the company's 125th anniversary with the release of a new cinnamon variant.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Plasmon biscuits are a biscuit containing plasmon, a proprietary dried milk. The manufacturers claimed that three pounds (1.4 kg) of plasmon equalled 100 imperial pints (57 L) of milk.  Plasmon was manufactured by the International Plasmon Company and was added to a number of different products to make Plasmon Oats, Plasmon Cocoa and Plasmon Biscuits. Plasmon biscuits are still manufactured in Italy by the H. J. Heinz Company.\n\nHistory\nPlasmon itself was a powder, milk albumen, which could be mixed into various other foods to make it palatable. Plasmon biscuits were popular around the turn of the 20th century and were considered a health food. They were used by Ernest Shackleton in his Antarctic Expedition of 1902.  On Christmas Day he wrote \"Had a hot lunch. I was cook: \u2013 Bovril, chocolate and plasmon biscuit, two spoonfuls of jam each. Grand!\". A variety of plasmon biscuit, said to be like digestives, was also made by Jacob's in 1915.Victor Whitechurch's fictional vegetarian detective Thorpe Hazell ate them daily. The journal of actress Ellen Terry records that George Bernard Shaw \"generally dined off a plasmon biscuit and a bean!\".  George Strachey Fawle (1856\u20131936), a director of the International Plasmon Company (Ltd.), said he attributed his recovery from serious illness to plasmon. Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) was an investor in the company and also promoted the powder's health benefits. He ate it daily himself, induced various members of his family to take it in its more palatable forms and kept the reading table by his bed well stocked with a variety of the products, inviting callers to try a sample. J.Y.M. MacAlister, another investor in the company, and Clemens are credited by Clemens' biographer, Albert Paine, with convincing the Medical Director-General of the British Army to adopt plasmon as a food for convalescent soldiers during the Second Boer War. Paine himself was urged to try the various products and reports that one of its more palatable forms was the \"preparation of chocolate\".\n\nPhysical culture\nPlasmon consumption was advocated by the physical culture and vegetarian communities during the early 20th-century. It was marketed as a food to gain muscle and strength. In 1901, Eugen Sandow stated that \"Plasmon is the essential food I have so long wish for and I would never be without it\". Adverts for Plasmon often contained pseudoscientific health claims that promoted concepts of masculinity.Eustace Miles, a physical culturist and vegetarian promoted plasmon as a muscle building food suitable for children, adults and athletes.\n\nPlasmon Society\nIn Italy, the Plasmon Society, founded initially as the Italian Plasmon Syndicate in 1902 until its renaming in 1916, based in Milan, would grow to prominence during the interwar period and after World War II, going from importing and marketing pure plasmon, to producing and selling plasmon biscuits, plasmon pasta, and plasmon chocolate. They would later be acquired by the H. J. Heinz Company in 1963, renamed to Plasmon Dietetic Food in 1976, and directly incorporated into the company by 1995, still producing its products such as its Plasmon biscuits to this day.\nIn Serbia, it is often said that following the acquisition of the Plasmon Society by Heinz, mass layoffs occurred at the factories which operated at the time, with one of the workers laid-off, Petar Tutavac (1934-2022), deciding to return to his native hometown of Po\u017earevac and setting in motion the foundation of the Serbian food company Bambi a.d. and the creation of its popular Plazma biscuits in 1967 and 1968 respectively, sold as Lane biscuits outside of former Yugoslavia to avoid further litigation from Heinz. This origin story however has been disputed by Bambi's founder, Mom\u010dilo Filipovi\u0107, who explained in an interview how Plazma's creation stemmed from his ambition to expand Leskovac\u2019s wheat mill into biscuit production, an idea which was not met with much enthusiasm by the city, which wanted to develop its more traditional textiles industry instead. After acquiring the rights and technology from Italian producers after lengthy negotiations, Bambi was set up in Po\u017earevac, and Tutovac, in actuality a master-baker from a small biscuit factory in Croatia, was brought on board, only to rise up to become the technical director.\n\n\n== References ==",

Speculoos was developed in the 20th century around the area of Verviers, as an alternative for people who could not afford Dutch speculaas. Fewer spices are involved in the process of making Belgian speculoos than in Dutch speculaas, as the spices were much more expensive to import to Belgium than to the Netherlands.  The origins of speculaas are much older. In the 2020s the names speculaas and speculoos are sometimes used interchangeably in Flanders.\n\nBrands\nIn Europe, Lotus Speculoos is the most recognized brand. This manufacturer supplied the biscuits individually packaged to the catering industry. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the same company is branded as Lotus Biscoff, short for biscuit with coffee. In October 2020, Lotus Bakeries decided to omit the word \"speculoos\" from local markets, to harmonise their brand. Several chains of supermarkets have started their own product under their generic name. In the US, windmill or almond windmill cookies are mostly based on speculoos.\n\nSpread or paste\nWorkers in the Low Countries traditionally made a sandwich in the morning with butter and speculaas or speculoos biscuits. This took on a spread-like consistency by lunchtime. In 2008, two competitors entered a contest on the Belgian television show, The Inventors (de Bedenkers), with a spread made from speculoos cookies \u2014 Els Scheppers, who reached the semi-finals, and the team of chef Danny De Mayer and Dirk De Smet, who were not selected as finalists. Spreads made from crushed Speculoos biscuits went into production by three separate companies and become popular.By 2007, several Belgian companies began marketing a speculoos paste, now available worldwide under various brands and names: as Speculla, Cookie Butter, and Biscoff Spread. As a form of spreadable speculoos biscuits, the flavour is caramelized and gingerbread-like, with a colour similar to peanut butter and a consistency ranging from creamy to granular or crunchy. The spread consists of 60% crushed speculoos biscuits and vegetable oils. In the United States the grocery chain Trader Joe's sells its own brand of cookie butter and cookie butter ice cream.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Speculoos at Wikimedia Commons",

On one hand, it is said that they come from an ancient Arab recipe, it is also said that olive oil torta was a traditional sweet created in southern Spain.\n\nLiterary references\nGuzm\u00e1n de Alfarache, a novel from the end of 16th or beginning of the 17th century, mentions olive oil tortas; saying:\n\nDale mis encomiendas, aunque no lo conozco, y dile que me pesa mucho y parte con \u00e9l de aquesa conserva, que para ti, bien m\u00edo, la ten\u00eda guardada. Ma\u00f1ana es d\u00eda de amasijo y te har\u00e9 una torta de aceite con que sin verg\u00fcenza puedas convidar a tus camaradas. (Guzm\u00e1n, C\u00e1tedra, 1987, 486)\nGive him my regards, though I do not know him, and tell him I am sorry and bring them this preserved food I kept for you. Tomorrow is the day for kneading and I will prepare an olive oil torta for you to invite your comrades.\nThey are also mentioned in the novel Don Quijote de la Mancha:\n\nPor eso digo\u2014dijo el del Bosque\u2014que nos dejemos de andar buscando aventuras; y pues tenemos hogazas, no busquemos tortas, y volv\u00e1monos a nuestras chozas, que all\u00ed nos hallar\u00e1 Dios, si \u00c9l quiere. (Quijote, Rico, 734)\nThis is the reason why I say\u2014said the man of the forest\u2014let's stop looking for adventure; and as we have loaves, we are not going to look for tortas, and let us return to our huts, God will find us there, if He wills.\n\nSee also\nList of almond dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

        "body": "Heviin boov (Mongolian: \u0443\u043b \u0431\u043e\u043e\u0432) is a traditional Mongolian biscuit assembled in layers. The number of layers in the cake represents the status of the family. The individual biscuits are stamped with a wooden block that imprints a design unique to the family, passed down through generations. It is traditionally served with aaruul in between the layers or on top.\n\nTerminology\nUl boov means \"shoe soles\" in English language, not to be confused with the French pastry palmier, which is also known as \"shoe soles\" in the cuisine of the Southern United States.\n\nHistory\nUl boov is prepared by Mongolians for the Mongolian lunar new year, Tsagaan Sar. Tsagaan Sar is a lavish feast, requiring preparation days in advance, as the men and women make large quantities of buuz as a whole family, along with ul boov, a pastry reserved for both dessert and presentation. During Mongolia's Communist period, the government banned Tsagaan Sar after Choibalsan's death in 1952 and tried to replace it with a holiday called \"Collective Herder's Day\", but the holiday was practiced again after the 1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia.\n\nPreparation\nSee also\nList of cakes\nMongolian cuisine\nTsagaan Sar\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Ul boov at Wikimedia Commons",

        "body": "Viscount (  VY-kownt) biscuits are a classic British biscuit which consist of a circular base of biscuit, topped with a creamy mint or orange flavouring and covered with a layer of milk chocolate. They are made by Burton's Foods.\nViscounts have shiny foil wrappers with different colours depending on the biscuit inside\u2014mint biscuits are contained within a green foil wrapper and orange flavoured biscuits (now discontinued) were contained within an orange wrapper. The wrapper features the word Viscount printed on it. A double chocolate version was also available for a time.Viscount biscuits were redesigned in April 2005, to make the product more appealing to the adult luxury market. The redesign was done by Beswick Design. As part of the redesign, Burton's launched a mini version of the Viscount, which comes in a tub similar to those used for packaging ice cream. However, the coloured wrappers for the two flavours were retained.For a period during the mid- to late- 1990s, double chocolate Viscount biscuits were available, with a chocolate cream filling, and were sold in a purple foil wrapper.\nIn November 2010, Burton's launched Cadbury Festives as part of its Cadbury Christmas Biscuits range, these are essentially the same as Viscount Biscuits, but branded under the Cadbury name, with Cadbury Chocolate used in place of the standard Chocolate coating.\nBurton's customer services department have confirmed (1 October 2014) that they no longer manufacture the orange-flavour Viscount biscuits.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBurton's Biscuit Co website Lyon's page\nNutrition information for Viscount biscuits",

        "body": "A water biscuit (Commonwealth English) or water cracker (American English) is a type of savoury cracker. They are thin, hard and brittle, and usually served with cheese or wine. Originally produced in the 19th century as a version of the ship's biscuit, water biscuits continue to be popular in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, with the leading brands (Carr's and Jacob's) selling over seventy million packets a year.\nIn 1801, Josiah Bent began a baking operation in Milton, Massachusetts, selling \"water crackers\" or biscuits made of flour and water that would not deteriorate during long sea voyages from the port of Boston. His company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the American Civil War. These were commercial versions/refinements of the hardtack biscuits which had long been used by the British Royal Navy and other European navies.\nSeveral versions of water crackers exist in ex-British colonies, such as Trinidad and Tobago , where Crix brand water biscuits are a popular breakfast and snack staple. They are often served with a spread, including a spicy pepper-and-herring paste called Solomon Gundy.\n\nSee also\n\n\n== References ==",
